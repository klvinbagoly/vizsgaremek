        "content": "Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire, England) is a Grammy-winning, British singer, songwriter, and actor. As a member of the British boy band One Direction, singer Harry Styles topped the charts, toured the world, and sold millions of albums before going solo in 2016. Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and he made his first foray into music with a high-school band named White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home and joined the seventh season of The X Factor, where fate (and Simon Cowell) would eventually lead him toward a life-changing opportunity with four other young men. As One Direction, Styles and his group mates Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne would release five albums from 2011 to 2015, hitting number one across the globe and selling millions of records to an adoring and rabid fan base that drew comparisons to the fervor at the height of Beatlemania. In early 2016, after Malik had already parted ways with 1D, the remaining foursome announced their indefinite hiatus. Months later, Styles signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Reflecting the influence of childhood favorites like Queen, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles, Styles' solo material took a more serious and rock-based approach, while still delivering the pop sound his faithful 1D fans desired. With the help of Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (who had worked with Kanye West and Bruno Mars), Styles put together a small band and, after rehearsing the songs, headed to Jamaica for two months to record an album. \"Sign of the Times,\" a plaintive ballad, was released as its first single in April of 2017. The self-titled full-length followed in May and debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. After 2 world tours, Harry set to write his sophomore album \"Fine Line\" releasing the hit songs \"Lights Up\",  \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\" as the singles. Fine line was released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. On March 14, 2021, Harry received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Watermelon Sugar\" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for Best Music Video with \"Adore You\" and for Best Pop Vocal Album for his album \"Fine Line\". In May of the same year, Styles also won the Brit Award for British Single for \"Watermelon Sugar\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\n\nBorn in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous self-titled debut studio album, \"Taylor Swift\" in 2006, which included the singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and \"Our Song\". Swift also released the holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, later titled as \"The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection\" in October 2007.\n\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, \"Speak Now\" (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles \"Mine\" and \"Back to December\". \n\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album \"Red\" (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, \"1989\" (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, \"reputation\" (2017) and \"Lover\" (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", \"Look What You Made Me Do\", \"ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)\" and \"You Need to Calm Down\". Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, \"folklore\" and \"evermore\" (both 2020), whose lead singles \"cardigan\" and \"willow\" topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. \n\nSwift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020, as a result of a publiscized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In February 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\". The album was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor’s Version)\", the re-recorded version of her original 2008 rendition, and two new tracks, \"You All Over Me (feat. Maren Morris) (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)\" with Maren Morris and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)\". It debuted at number one in the US. \n\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— \"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\", and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack\", co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \"Eyes Open\". \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded \"Sweeter than Fiction\", a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called \"Beautiful Ghosts\", which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song \"Only the Young\" which was written after the 2018 United States elections.\n\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 [https://guinnessworldrecords.com/]Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019).

However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.\n\nThe Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.\n\nIn 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.\n\nHis second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.\n\nHis third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.\n\nNext came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.\n\nTesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.\n\nAlthough widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye's After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.\n\nHis fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991) also known as Tyler, The Creator, a Grammy award-winning American rapper, singer, record producer, director, fashion designer, and the head of his own independent record label, Odd Future Records. He was the leader of now-defunct Los Angeles, California, USA hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA). Since his first recordings had debuted on The Odd Future Tape in 2007, he had rapped on, and produced for, nearly every OFWGKTA release. \n\nTyler, The Creator is Okonma's most commonly used alias, and the one that both of his first two albums are credited to, but he has used several others as well, including Wolf Haley, Ace (or Ace Creator), and Young N***a, the latter of which was part of a prank on OFWGKTA's official site.  Many other characters or alter egos and names are featured in his music, such as Tron Cat, a therapist called Dr. TC, and most recently, Tyler Baudelaire, the character from the 2021 album CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST.\n\nIn 2009, Tyler self-released his debut mixtape B*stard as a free download off of the official OFWGKTA website.  Two music videos were released for tracks off of B*stard, \"VCR\" and \"French!,\" both of which were directed by Tyler (credited as Wolf Haley).  The album is focused around dialogues between Tyler and Dr. TC, and it received generally positive reviews from critics and blogs alike.\n\nAfter signing to XL Recordings in February 2011, he released \"Yonkers,\" the lead single off his sophomoric album Goblin, which was released on May 10, 2011. The music video for \"Yonkers\" (directed by Tyler credited as Wolf Haley) won Tyler The 2011 MTV Video Music Award for \"Best New Artist,\" as well as a nomination for Video of the Year (which lost to Katy Perry's \"Firework\").  \n\nGoblin, an album described as \"dark,\" \"monolithic,\" and \"a natural sequel to B*stard,\" continues the sessions with Tyler's fictional therapist, with Tyler venting to Dr. TC about fame, message boards, critics, hype, expectations, media scrutiny, and the idea of being a role model.  All of the production was handled by Tyler, save for \"Transylvania,\" which was produced by fellow OFWGKTA member Left Brain.\n\nTyler's third studio album, known as Wolf,  was released in 2013.  Tyler alluded to several possible track names on his Formspring account, and he stated that the album would focus less on rapping and more on production.  In an interview with DJ Semtex, he confirmed that he would handle all the production on the album, except one song produced by Left Brain, the same approach that was used for Goblin.  On February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA uploaded a video to their YouTube account, which included L-Boy skydiving and stating that on April 2, 2013. Tyler revealed three album covers via his Instagram. The first single from the album was released on February 14, 2013, titled \" Domo 23\" along with the music video which features cameos from Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco Bennett. On February 26, 2013, Tyler performed the songs \"Domo23\" and \"Treehome95\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+the+Creator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Ariana Grande-Butera is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She is a multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning recording artist. Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical, 13. She rose to prominence for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series, Victorious (2010–2013) and in its spin-off, Sam & Cat (2013–2014). As she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of Victorious and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered videos of her covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, Yours Truly, in 2013. A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned her first US top-ten single, \"The Way\", featuring rapper Mac Miller. \n\nGrande's second studio album, My Everything (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated EDM elements. It topped the Billboard 200 and featured four US top-ten singles: \"Problem\", \"Break Free\", \"Bang Bang\", and \"Love Me Harder\", the most of any artist that year. Grande's pop-R&B styles extended on her third studio album, Dangerous Woman (2016), which was her first of three consecutive number-one albums in the UK, and spawned top ten hits such as the Grammy nominated title track and \"Side to Side\". On her next two albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), Grande experimented with trap while maintaining her characteristic pop-R&B tones; being projects with her most creative control yet and showing a more personal and vulnerable side, both debuted at number one in several countries and were acclaimed by music critics. The former won a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned the international top three hit \"No Tears Left to Cry\", while the latter broke several streaming records. Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously when \"7 Rings\", \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" and \"Thank U, Next\" did so in 2019. She is also the first artist to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.\n\nGrande has received various accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and three American Music Awards. All five of Grande's full-length albums have been certified platinum by the RIAA. As one of the leading streaming pioneers in the world, she has amassed over 35 billion streams on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music and is the most listened female on the latter two. An influential figure on social media, she is an outspoken feminist and supporter for LGBT rights. She asserts control over her public image and is known for her ponytail hairdo and bold fashion statements. In February 2019, she became the most followed woman on Instagram. Forbes ranked her amongst the highest-paid celebrities in 2019, and Time named Grande as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016 and 2019. Billboard recognized her as the \"Woman of the Year\" in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Frank Ocean (born October 28, 1987) is an American singer/songwriter and member of the gleefully hedonistic hip-hop collective OFWGKTA. He was born Christopher Edwin Breaux in Long Beach, California. He has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyoncé over the last few years. In 2011, Ocean released his debut mixtape, , for free via his Tumblr.\n\nVenting about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to Twitter on March 1, 2011: \"i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that's why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck Def Jam & any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams & talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag.\"\n\nAs a member of the Odd Future (OFWGKTA) collective, his sound is distinctively soulful/r&b influenced, yet done in a way that could pass for something totally different. As Tyler, the Creator states, “It’s Smooth Ass Music About Bitches, Relationships And Being A Rich Young Nigga…But In A Swagged Out Way.” \n\nOcean was evacuated from the University of New Orleans to Los Angeles, California just as Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, and stayed in Los Angeles to pursue a music career. Ocean joined Los Angeles based collective OFWGKTA, who he met through mutual friends, at the end of 2009. In the end of 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as an artist, however, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In 2010, he changed his name from Christopher \"Lonny\" Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean via a legal website. In an April 2011 interview, Ocean intimated that his relationship with Def Jam has strengthened since the release of his mixtape. On April 28, 2011, Ocean was arrested on unspecified charges by the LAPD, and was released on the morning after on April 29, 2011. Ocean joined his OFWGKTA bandmates for the first time on tour from May 12 to May 19, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Def Jam released the single Novacane on iTunes soon followed by Swim Good Taken from his mixtape Nostalgia, ULTRA. His first 'proper' album, Channel Orange was released on July 17th, 2012.\nIn 2016, He released the visual album Endless alongside his second studio album Blonde, following several years of delays. Blonde debuted at number one in the United States and United Kingdom.\nIn 2017, Ocean released several singles, including Chanel  and Lens, through his Blonded Radio show, and made several appearances on other songs by artists like Calvin Harris, A$AP Mob, and Tyler, the Creator. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), popularly known as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. His eponymous debut mixtape was released on April 14, 2017. He originally went by the moniker Sir Cartier (stylized as $ir Cartier) when he embarked on his music career in 2011.\n\nHe originally started rapping as Sir Cartier, releasing a mixtape titled THC: THE HIGH CHRONICAL$ on November 5, 2011, that has since been deleted from the Internet. He followed up with Young Misfit on November 12, 2012. He changed his artist name to Playboi Carti in May 2013. As Playboi Carti, he came into prominence in 2015 with his song Broke Boi. Initially a part of the Atlanta-based Awful Records label, he also performed at the fashion events such as Yeezy Season 5, VFiles and Raf Simons events, with artists such as Lil Uzi Vert and A$AP Rocky. In 2016, he was featured on A$AP Mob's debut studio album, Cozy Tapes: Vol. 1 Friends -, on the tracks London Town and Telephone Calls, which the latter was released as the second single from the album.\n\nCarti's eponymous debut mixtape,Playboi Carti, which features guest appearances from Lil Uzi Vert, A$AP Rocky, and Leven Kali, was released on April 14, 2017. The self-titled release gained attention from various music publications, including XXL, Pitchfork, Spin, HotNewHipHop and PopMatters. XXL noted the track Magnolia as a standout cut, whereas Pitchfork critic Briana Younger thought that the release \"finds a cloudy and economical mood and stays there, but it's Carti's magnetic confidence that turns just enough into plenty.\" The mixtape sold 28,051 units in its opening week.\n\nIn accompaniment with the mixtape's release, Carti embarked a tour, which featured him as an opening act for Gucci Mane and Dreezy.\n\nFor the end of 2017, Carti was featured on A$AP Mob's Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy, A$AP Ferg's Still Striving, and NAV's Perfect Timing. Carti was meanwhile working on his debut album, Die Lit, which would be released on May 11, 2018.\n\nDie Lit was an album that released mixed reviews, but fans of Carti enjoyed the album. Die Lit includes notable tracks such as \"Shoota\", \"Foreign\", \"Choppa Won't Miss\", \"Mileage\", and \"Poke it Out.\" This album included features from artists such as Lil Uzi Vert, Nicki Minaj, Chief Keef, Young Thug, Travis Scott, and Bryson Tiller.\n\nSince the release of Die Lit, Playboi Carti has embarked on his own tour, while featuring on songs such as \"Uh Uh\" on Chief Keef's Mansion Musick and \"Get Dripped\" on Lil Yachty's Nuthin' 2 Prove.\n\nHowever, soon after the release of Die Lit and his tour, Carti was seen discussing a new album: Whole Lotta Red. Over the course of the next few years, \"Whole Lotta Red\" would get leaked, or played by Carti himself at select shows. On November 23 2020, Carti announced that the album had been submitted to his label, along with posting several blurry photos. He would later announce several collaborations, with artists such as Kanye West and Future. DJ Akademiks would later tweet that the album would release on Christmas day, and was executively produced by Kanye West.\n\nFan reception was polarizing at the start, but the album met critical positive reception. The album would later grow on Carti fans and music enjoyers alike, and began receiving high praise. It has since been solidified as the greatest album of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a multiple Grammy Award-Winning English singer-songwriter from Tottenham, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. \n\nHer second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nAdele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.\n\nAdele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an \"essential\" Blue Eyed Soul recording.\n\nIn June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.\n\nThe much-anticipated third studio album \"25\" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, \"Hello\", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  \n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for \"Album of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for \"25\". and \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\" for \"Hello\".\n\nAdele is set to release her fourth studio album, the hotly-anticipated 30, on November 19, 2021. It will be preceded by lead single \"Easy on Me,\" which is due out on October 15. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Ye (born Kanye Omari West on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia), professionally known as Kanye West, is a Grammy award-winning American rapper, producer, singer, author, director, performance artist and fashion designer.\n\nWest began making beats and rapping in the early 90s in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois, when he formed the rap group Go Getters with Chicago natives GLC and Really Doe. He later gained nationwide popularity through his work in New York, where he began producing tracks for artists such as Jay-Z, Twista, Mase, Talib Kweli and Alicia Keys.\n\nWest's style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced was The Truth by Beanie Sigel, and his first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was This Can’t Be Life, a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West said he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre’s Xxplosive to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can’t Be Life.\n\nWest has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol’ Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: “Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time… We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.”\n\nIn 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn't a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received critical acclaim, including 10 Grammy nominations and the awards for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, as well as defining the style for which West would become known: \"wordplay\" and heavy sampling of 70s soul and RnB tracks. \n\nNot content to rest on his laurels, West invested two million dollars and hired a string orchestra to help with his latest effort, Late Registration (2005). West collaborated with Jon Brion to help develop the sound of the album, despite his lack of experience in hip hop production. The album received widespread acclaim like its predecessor, and again claimed the Best Rap Album award at the Grammys.\n\nWest was no stranger to controversy, such as storming out at the 2004 American Music Awards after not receiving Best New Artist, but just days after the release of his second studio album, West began embroiled in a major controversy after going off-script during a Hurricane Katrina broadcast, proclaiming \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\", which Bush claimed was \"one the most disgusting moments of my presidency\". In January 2006, West posed on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns, once again attracting controversy.\n\nFor his third release, West was keen to produce songs which could be used more effectively when performing in arenas. For Graduation, the third and ultimately final entry into his 'Dropout Bear' series, West drew musical inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. In the lead up to the album he became involved in a friendly rivalry with 50 Cent over which of the two artists' upcoming albums would sell more, as they were both released on the same day. West ultimately sold 957,000 copies in the first week of release, outselling Curtis by a large margin. The albums lead single \"Stronger\" sampled Daft Punk, and was West's third number one on Billboard 200. Many proclaim West's 'victory' over 50 Cent to be the 'death' of gangster rap as the dominant hip hop subgenre.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Donda West, and the end of his engagement to long term partner Alexis Phifer, West abandoned his initial plan to release a fourth album entitled Good Ass Job, and shocked his fans by releasing 808s and Heartbreak, which was full of autotune singing, extensive use of the TR-808 drum machine, themes of love, loss and loneliness and very little rapping. It received slightly more mixed reviews than his previous efforts, but many critics cite 808s and Heartbreak as the catalyst for a new wave of rappers, most prominently Drake, due to its themes which were uncommon in mainstream hip-hop.\n\nWest's grief seemed to lead to a spiral out of control which culminated in him storming on stage at the 2009 VMAs to interrupt Taylor Swift's award acceptance speech to proclaim that Beyoncé deserved the award instead, in a move that is infamous in pop culture and was vilified by the entire world in the aftermath. West disappeared from the public eye following this, and his upcoming tour with Lady Gagawas cancelled. The disgraced West, who was described as a 'jackass' by President Obama, seemed to have much work to do to return to the his former glory, but he was about to embark on what some critics consider to be the best run of his career.\n\nWest holed up in Hawaii over the course of a few months and worked tirelessly to produce what many consider to be his magnum opus. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, which solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit All of the Lights, and Billboard hits Power, Monster, and Runaway, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program G.O.O.D. Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, a portion of which were included on the album. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a \"snub\" by several media outlets.\n\nFollowing a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as \"one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time,\" West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. Niggas in Paris became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: Mercy and Clique. West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.\n\nSessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to \"undermine the commercial,\" he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.\n\nYeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut. Def Jam issued \"Black Skinhead\" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, accompanying him along the way.\n\nIn November 2013, West stated that he was working on and recording his next studio album. The album was to be produced by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip.. Kanye released a single entitled \"Only One\", on December 31, 2014 featuring Paul McCartney, as well as collaborating with McCartney on the Rihanna track \" FourFiveSeconds\", released in January 2015. West appeared on the SNL 40th Anniversary Special on February 15th 2015 to debut a new song Wolves, featuring Sia Furler and Vic Mensa. Another single, entitled \"All Day\"  was released on March 2, 2015, again featuring McCartney as well as Theophilus London, Allan Kingdom. In June of the same year, Kanye headlined the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, which garnered much outrage including a petition with 135,000 signatures against his appearance, leading to West declaring he was \"the greatest living rock star on the planet\" towards the end of his set, and the performance receiving a mixed reaction among fans and critics, due to its controversy. In September 2015, West performed {album artist kanye west]808s and Heartbreak in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl over two nights, which received rave reviews a featured a 60 person orchestra, guests such as Kid Cudi and Mr Hudson, and over 70 dancers. West released \"Facts\" at the turn of the new year. \n\nWest had originally stated that his upcoming album would be called 'So Help Me God' before changing the title to 'SWISH' and announcing that it would be released on February 11th. In January 2016 he released \"Real Friends\" and \"No More Parties in LA\", featuring Kendrick Lamar. As well as renaming the album once again to \"Waves\", West became involved in several twitter controversies in the lead up to the album, including with rapper Wiz Khalifa after he suggested that West had stolen the idea of the wave from other artists and seemingly dissed Kim Kardashian, which later turned out to be a misunderstanding over the use of \"KK\". West again changed the name of the album just days before it's release, this time to \"{album artist=kanye west]The Life of Pablo\", and debuted it at Madison Square Garden on February 11, but delayed it's release for a few days. On February 14, West released the album are a performance on SNL. West initially claimed the album was to be a Tidal exclusive, but it was later released on other streaming platforms, although it is yet to receive a physical release. West continued to tinker with the mixing and production of the album even after it was released, and it was updated several times, including the final song \"Saint Pablo\" in June 2016. West had also made public his plans to release an album in the summer of 2016, entitled \"Turbo Grafx 16\", based on the 1990s games console, which never surfaced, although he did release a single thought to be from the upcoming G.O.O.D. Music album \"Cruel Winter\", called  Champions. In the same month, a video for \"Famous\" was released, including nude wax figures of celebrities such as West, Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Bill Cosby and George W. Bush. \n\nIn August 2016, West embarked on the ambitious Saint Pablo Tour, which included a mobile stage suspended from the ceiling. After the violent robbery of Kim's jewellery in Paris in October, West had to end a show early and postpone shows following it. In the following performances, West cancelled shows early and went on long winded rants against fellow artists such as Jay Z and Beyoncé among others, as well as making controversial political statements including implying his support for Donald Trump. On November 21st 2016, West cancelled the rest of the tour and was hospitalised due to sleep deprivation and extreme dehydration. Following this, West disappeared from social media, and only resurfaced 11 months later with a series of tweets which included many philosophical thoughts and the announcements two albums in June 2018, a solo album which would include 7 tracks on June 1, and a collaboration with Kid Cudi to be released on June 8.  \n\nOn August 29th, 2021, Kanye released his 10th highly anticipated studio release Donda via GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings after a series of three listening parties.\n\nPersonal life:\nWest was born in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old (as mentioned in Hey Mama) his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, was a former Black Panther; one of the first black photojournalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and is now a Christian counselor. Kanye’s late mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as a Professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye’s manager. He was later raised in an upper middle class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.\n\nAfter attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Chicago State University but eventually dropped out due to poor grades and in order to continue working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists, including on rapper Grav’s debut album Down to Earth. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip hop/R&B artists, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Cam’ron, Paul Wall, Common, Mobb Deep, Jermaine Dupri, Scarface, The Game, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and John Legend among others. He also “ghost-produced” for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song Last Call and the credits of Nas’ Poppa Was a Playa.\n\nKanye was married to Kim Kardashian. Together they had four children: daughters named North (*2013) and Chicago (*2018); and sons named Saint (*2015) and Psalm (*2019). In 2021, Kardashian filed for divorce. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, Mikey Margott and Brandon Fried. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January, 2014.\n\nThe band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 on the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. \n\nIn early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled \"Female Robbery.\" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, \"Sweater Weather,\" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.\n\nAlthough The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamor for more information with even greater fervor. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled \"I'm Sorry,\" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.\n\nSo who are The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which formed in August of 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie onboard to collaborate on \"Female Robbery.\" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.\n\n\"I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,\" Rutherford says. \"I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.\"\n\n\"I'm Sorry,\" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed \"black and white\" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely in rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. \"When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,\" Rutherford explains. \"And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.\"\n\nIn the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Radiohead is an English alternative rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK which formed in 1985. The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).\n\nThe early years (1992 – 1995)\nRadiohead released their first single, \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans.\n\nInternational success (1996 - 2000)\nRadiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.\n\nA change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI.\n\nIndependent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)\nIn 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.\n\nIn 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.\n\nIn February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.\n\nNinth Studio Album - \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" (2016)\nAfter much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited ninth album,\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was \"Burn the Witch\".\n\nGlastonbury 2017\nOn October 20, 2016, Radiohead were announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After Akon recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent, he signed her to a joint deal with his own label, Kon Live Distribution, and then she started to work on her own new material for her debut album.\n\nGaga released \"The Fame\" in 2008, which she explained was \"about how anyone can feel famous.\" To date, the album has spawned the international number one hit singles “Just Dance\" (nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards) and \"Poker Face. The Fame then went Diamond in February 2010, selling over 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nShe then continued to release a new album 1 year later, \"The Fame Monster\", which she wasn't intending to make at first. She released “Bad Romance\" as the first single, and has been nominated for dozens of awards all over the world. After The Fame Monster was released she released two more singles \"Telephone (feat. Beyoncé)\" and \"Alejandro\". She released \"Dance in the Dark\" as a promotional single, but only released it in Australia, New Zealand, and France. She undertook a large scale tour since \"The Fame Monster\" was released, and referred to her shows as The Monster Ball.\n\nLady Gaga announced her new album name, \"Born This Way\" at the 2010 MTV VMAs and it was released on May 23. 2011, and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. It was her second studio album and received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its range of different styles and her vocals. “Born This Way” received three Grammy Award nominations, including Lady Gaga’s third consecutive for Album of the Year. The accompanying tour, entitled “Born This Way Ball”, kicked off in April 2012 with over 100 shows scheduled worldwide. Due to a hip injury, Lady Gaga canceled the remainder of the tour in February 2013. \n\nOn November 6, 2013, Lady Gaga released her third studio album entitled “Artpop”, with featured guest appearances from T.I., Too Short, Twista and R. Kelly. “Artpop” is a synthpop album, infused with urban, R&B, techno, rock and electronic beats. The album received mixed reviews from critics with some praising Lady Gaga’s vocals, with others criticizing its perceived lack of maturity. Following a 2-day release event – “ArtRave” – the album debuted at number 1 in the US, and charted in the top 10 in over 20 countries.\n\nApplause was serviced as the lead single from Artpop on August 12, 2013, and was a critical and commercial success, charting within the top ten of more than twenty countries worldwide, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The second single Do What U Want was released on October 21, and peaked at number 13 in the United States. It was followed by promotional singles Venus and Dope shortly before the album's release. The album later produced the single G.U.Y. Gaga promoted Artpop with several television appearances and performances, including her second Thanksgiving Day special, Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular.\n\nOn February 5, 2017, Gaga performed at the half time show at 2017's Super Bowl at Houston's NRG Stadium. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro, Frank Iero and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later.\n\nThe band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. Their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released on November 22, 2010, to positive reviews. The band's final release was a series of singles, released over the course of five months, collected on the compilation Conventional Weapons. The band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. On March 25, 2014, the band released May Death Never Stop You: The Greatest Hits (2001–2013), a greatest hits album containing material spanning their entire career, as well as some previously unreleased material.\n\nOn Halloween of 2019, the band announced a comeback show in Los Angeles, California, and fans speculated that there was more to it than just a show. On November 5, 3 more shows were confirmed in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. On January 29, 2020, eighteen additional dates were announced in North America. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/My+Chemical+Romance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Onfroy was known for his versatility with his music, which ranges from aggressive, punk rock-inspired hip hop, to somber and slower R&B style songs, to even heavy metal. His music is known for the lofi sound quality of his vocals and songs, which normally are distorted and unmastered. His vocal style ranged from singing, rapping, and screaming. Onfroy was also known for his violent outbursts in public life, with numerous arrests related to assault, robbery, and weapon possession. \n\nOnfroy's most popular song to-date is Look at Me, which was originally released in 2016 and re-released in 2017, and peaked at number 42 on US Billboard Hot 100. The single helped him gain more popularity in early 2017 due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his then unreleased song, now released under the name \"KMT\", that he previewed at a concert in Amsterdam featuring British rapper Giggs.\n\nIn July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After posting bail in early October of the same year, while awaiting trial, Onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim. Onfroy was released from jail on bail on March 26, 2017.\n\nOnfroy announced his debut studio album, 17 on July 30, 2017. The album released on August 25, 2017. It features 11 tracks and includes the lead single Revenge.\n\nOnfroy was shot and killed on June 18, 2018, in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/xxxtentacion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Imagine Dragons is a Grammy award-winning alternative rock band which formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - \"Imagine Dragons\" (2009), \"Hell and Silence\" (2010), \"It's Time\" (2011) and \"Continued Silence\" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album \"Night Visions\" on 4 September 2012.\n\nThe band's single \"It's Time\", which previously appeared on the \"It's Time\" and \"Continued Silence\" EPs in addition to appearing on \"Night Visions\", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of indie rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. \n\nA third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.\n\nSeveral tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.\n\nGreat songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. \n\nDespite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "George Miller, known by his stage name Joji, is a Japanese-Australian singer-songwriter, record producer and former YouTube personality.\n\nIn 2013, on the DizastaMusic YouTube channel, Miller created the video \"Do the Harlem Shake (Original),\" which originated from a clip of the video \"Filthy Compilation #6 – Smell My Fingers\",the video has been viewed 60 million times (as of February 2019). The original clip led to the creation of the Harlem Shake meme, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's \"Harlem Shake\" song atop the Billboard Hot 100. In addition to the DizastaMusic channel (inactive since 2015), he has operated two other channels: TooDamnFilthy (a secondary channel) and TVFilthyFrank (main channel).\n\nHis absurdist YouTube channel, now defunct, consisted of music, rants, ukulele performances and a bizarre show, with all of the main characters played by Miller including the titular character of Filthy Frank. He also produced absurdist comedy music under the moniker Pink Guy, with his discography spanning two full-length albums and an extended play. His second album, Pink Season, debuted at number 70 on Billboard 200. \n\nIn late 2017, Miller retired the Youtube channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200 and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's top R&B and hip-hop chart in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian artist to do so. Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B and trip hop.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joji\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, \"The Fourth World\", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.\n\nIn 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, \"Songs About Jane\", in June 2002. The album's lead single \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's \"1.22.03.Acoustic\" and 2005's \"Live Friday the 13th\". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, \"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled \"Hands All Over\". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, \"Overexposed\", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, \"One More Night\" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, \"V\", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi (born January 30, 1984 in Shaker Heights, Ohio, United States), better known by his stage name KiD CuDi, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, singer and actor who first gained attention after the release of his debut mixtape A Kid Named Cudi which he released in 2008 in collaboration with New York street wear brand 10.Deep. The mixtape caught the attention of Kanye West and led to Cudi's signing to the G.O.O.D. Music Label. His debut album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day, was released September 15, 2009. The album has since been certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the US. His second studio album, Man On The Moon II: The Legend Of Mr Rager, was released on November 9th 2010. His third studio album, Indicud, was released on April 16, 2013. In addition to his solo career, Kid Cudi is also a member of the alternative rock duo WZRD. In February 2014, Cudi unexpectedly released his fourth album Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, exclusively to digital retailers, with little-to-no promotion.\n\nKid Cudi was born in Cleveland, Ohio and lived in the diverse upper class suburb of Shaker Heights.

Cudi first began rapping towards the end of high school, inspired by alternative hip hop groups such as The Pharcyde and A Tribe Called Quest. He moved to Brooklyn, New York to pursue a music career. In July 2008, Kid Cudi released his first mixtape, A Kid Named Cudi, in collaboration with New York street wear brand 10. Deep as a free download in 2008. The mixtape has had so much continued success that on May 18, 2009 10.Deep announced they were going to be doing a re-release of the \"Up There\" t-shirt and hard copies A Kid Named Cudi mixtape in their webstore on May 20, 2009 at 12:00 PM EST. Shortly after the shirt went up for sale the server crashed due to heavy traffic of fans wanting to buy the t-shirt and the mixtape.\n\nKid Cudi has a guest feature on Kanye West's 2008 album, 808s & Heartbreak, singing with him on the track Welcome to Heartbreak, providing additional vocals on Paranoid with Mr Hudson and helped with songwriting on the second single Heartless. A music video has been made and released for Welcome to Heartbreak with him in it. He also featured on the song Welcome 2 the World with Kevin Rudolf from his album In The City, and on 88-Keys debut album The Death of Adam on the track Ho' is Short for Honey.\n\nHe has been featured in many medias such as XXL and BBC News's Sound of 2009 poll of up-and-coming acts. He has also been featured in Vibe, Complex, The Source, Rolling Stone, URB and Interview magazine.\n\nKid Cudi first appeared on shows in 2008, when he performed at the 2008 VMA's alongside Travis Barker and DJ AM. On February 17, 2009, Kid Cudi made his TV debut on Snoop Dogg's new MTV talk show Dogg After Dark, performing Day 'n' Nite at the end of the show. Two days later on February 19, 2009, Cudi appeared on BET's 106 & Park with Kanye West to debut the video of Day 'n' Nite . On March 16, 2009 Kid Cudi performed on mtvU's 2009 Spring Break special. On March 17, 2009 Cudi appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly where he performed three songs. Kid Cudi has also made cameo appearances in Solange's video for her song T.O.N.Y. and in the Black Eyed Peas video for I Gotta Feeling.  \n\nKid Cudi, along with Emile, produced an exclusive single called \"Switchin Lanes\" for the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles, part of its \"South Central Premium Upgrade\" Downloadable Content (DLC) which came out March 19, 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and March 27, 2009 for the Xbox 360.

It surpassed 14 million online streams and spawned a number of remixes with Astronomyy, Blackbear, and Goldhouse. Eilish followed up in February 2017 with \"Bellyache,\" then landed another track, \"Bored,\" on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. An EP, dont smile at me, featuring the singles \"COPYCAT\" and \"watch,\" followed later that summer. Her debut full-length album When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We All Go? was released March 29th, 2019 via Interscope Records.\n\nOn January 26, 2020, she won five Grammys, including the \"big four\" awards: Best Album, Best Record, Best Song, and Best New Artist. On February 18th 2020, she won a Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist and for the first time performed her new James Bond theme song \"No Time to Die,\" joined by composer Hans Zimmer, guitar legend Johnny Marr and Finneas. The theme won Eilish and Finneas an Oscar for Best Original Song. Additionally, Eilish is the youngest musician to have ever performed the theme song for a Bond film. \n\n\nOn July 31, 2021, Billie Eilish has released her Sophomore Album \"Happier Than Ever\" that broke the internet two days the album was released. Eilish performed the album at the Life Is Beautiful festival performing for the first time since March 2020 when COVID happened. Eilish has planned a \"Happier Than Ever World Tour\" starting in February 2022 - July 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Arctic Monkeys is an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\n\nThe band has released six studio albums: \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" (2006), \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" (2007), \"Humbug\" (2009), \"Suck It and See\" (2011), \"AM\" (2013) and \"Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\" (2018) all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. \n\nEach of the band's first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12.\n\nThe band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\n\nThe band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.\n\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. \n\nThe single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.\n\nTheir debut album \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\n\nTheir second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by \"Brianstorm\", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.\n\nWhen asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Turner commented, \"We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls\".\n\nThe band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said \"We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.\"\n\nThe band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were \"Crying Lightning\", \"Go-Kart\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Pretty Visitors.\" The full setlist from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song \"Red Right Hand.\" During their last tour, the band had played new songs \"Put Me In A Terror Pocket\", \"Sandtrap,\" and \"The Fire and The Thud\" live.\n\nLead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.\nThe band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'\n\nThe Arctic Monkeys band released their album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single \"Crying Lightning\"\n\nThey released their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, on June 6th, 2011.\n\nThey released their fifth studio album, AM, on March 13th, 2013.\n\nThey released their sixth studio album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, with no preceding single releases, on May 11th, 2018.\n\nhttp://www.arcticmonkeys.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969 in Brooklyn, New York, United States), is an American rapper and former president and CEO of Roc A Fella Records. He is more commonly known by a variety of stage names including Jay-Z, S. Carter, Jigga, Hova, J-Hova, Hov, and Young Hov. He is regarded as one of the most prolific and successful American blend artists of the mid-90s and early 2000s and is known for his use of metaphors, freestyling abilities, word play, flow, and blending of street and popular hip hop. He is one of the most respected rappers in the music industry, and is admired for his ability to craft songs from  memory without the use of pen and paper. He married his long time girlfriend Beyonce in April 2008 after dating for over seven years. He is one of the founders of Roc-A-Fella Records, a hip-hop record label which also launched the careers of artists such as Beanie Sigel, Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, Young Gunz, Freeway, and Teairra Mari.\n\nEarly history\nOriginally from the infamous Marcy Houses projects in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn in New York City, Shawn Carter was abandoned by his father Adnes Reeves when he was only twelve years old and he was consequently raised by his mother Gloria Carter. Jay-Z attended George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn, NYC and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey but did not graduate. He claims to have been caught up in selling drugs on the streets of New York in the Marcy Projects. In addition to this, Jay-Z has lyrically alluded to having sold crack cocaine and marijuana in Virginia and Maryland.\n\nAccording to his mother, a young Jay-Z used to keep his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boombox for his birthday and thus sparked his interest in music. He began freestyling, writing rhymes, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time.\n\nIn his neighborhood, Carter was known as \"Jazzy,\" a nickname which eventually developed into his stage name, \"Jay-Z.\" The moniker is also a homage to his musical partner Lee Dub (www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy) Jaz-O (a.k.a. the Jaz, Big Jaz) as well as to the J-Z subway lines that have a stop at Marcy Avenue in Brooklyn.\n\nJay-Z can be heard on several of The Jaz's early recordings, including 1988's \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\", he also collaborated with Inglewood, California producer Three-1-Zero which began his popularity as an artist. His career had a jump start when he battled a rapper by the name of Zai. The battle caught the eye of many record labels, as Jay-Z was able to hold his own against Zai. He also made an appearance on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard.\"\n\nCommercial work\n\nFrom the beginning of his commercial recording career, Jay-Z chose a route that many would consider untraditional. Rather than waiting to get signed to a major label, Jay-Z created Roc-A-Fella Records as his own independent label. After striking a deal with Priority to distribute his material, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Clark Kent and a notable appearance by The Notorious B.I.G.. Although the album received critical acclaim, record sales were poor and were a disappointment.\n\nAfter reaching a new distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Executive produced by Diddy, it sold better than his previous effort even though Jay later explained that this was one of the worst periods of his life. He was reeling from the death of his close friend Biggie. Due to the glossy production on his sophomore album, many of the fans he'd earned previously now claimed he was selling out and catering to a more commercial audience. However, the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on Reasonable Doubt, namely DJ Premier and Ski.\n\n1998's Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem).\" Critics would still accuse him of becoming even more commercial and egotistical, due to the lack of intellectual matter on this album. He also relied more heavily on flow, developing it further, and he continued his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz and Timbaland. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\" featuring Ja Rule and \"Jigga What, Jigga Who.\". Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album, certifying platinum five times in the United States.\n\nIn 1999 Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. Despite continued criticism for his increasingly pop-oriented sound and a large number of collaborations that many felt crowded out Jay-Z himself, the album proved to be successful and went platinum three times. Through his lyricism, he was able to retain respect from some of his die-hard fans. Vol. 3 is remembered for its smash hit, \"Big Pimpin\" (feat UGK) and the negative remarks to then-underground New York rapper known as 50 Cent.\n\nBy this time, Jay-Z was seen as a hip-hop figurehead both by hardcore fans and by the corporations of rap due to his lyrics and his high album sales, achieving a pinnacle rarely held in rap music. The subject of much criticism, praise, popularity, condemnation, and discussion, Jay decided to begin developing other artists besides himself. Around 2000, he and Damon Dash signed various artists (including Beanie Sigel and Freeway) and began introducing them to the public. He next appeared on The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was intended as a compilation album to introduce these new artists, though the album had Jay-Z's name on it to strengthen sales and acclaim.\n\n2001's The Blueprint is considered by many to be one of hip hop's \"classic\" albums, receiving the coveted \"5 mic\" review from The Source magazine. Released on September 11, 2001, the album managed to debut at #1, selling more than 450,000 albums in its first week.\n\nThe Blueprint was applauded for its production and the balance of \"mainstream\" and \"hardcore\" rap, receiving recognition from both audiences. Eminem was the only guest artist on the album, producing and rapping on the single \"Renegade\" (to which rival Nas would rap, \"Eminem murdered you on your own shit\" on \"Ether.\") The Blueprint also includes the popular \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and \"Takeover\", a song which takes rivals Prodigy of Mobb Deep and Nas. A large portion of the material on this album was produced by Kanye West and represents one of West's first major breaks in the industry.\n\nA feud between Jay-Z and Nas culminated in \"Takeover\", a diss from Jay-Z to Nas, in the fall of 2001. Many fans praised the diss as an effective method to shut down Nas's career for good. Nas responded with the diss track \"Ether\". He shocked fans by creating arguably an even more lethal track than Takeover, and had regained his respect. Over the course of the feud, Jay-Z claims that he and Allen Iverson slept with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter, Destiny. Nas, in turn, accused Jay of brown nosing other artists for fame, and then leaving them for dead once he was famous. This feud proved to be a huge draw in the world of hip-hop. The feud died down over 2002 and was finally resolved in October 2005.\n\nJay-Z's next solo album was 2002's The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse a sprawling double-album which was touted by fans as having too much 'filler' or unnecessary material. It was later reissued in a single-disc version, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the tracks from the original. The album spawned two hit singles \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"03 Bonnie and Clyde\" featuring Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nIn 2003, Jay-Z toured with 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes and Sean Paul while finishing work on what was announced as his final album, The Black Album. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say,\" \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" \"Change Clothes,\" and \"99 Problems.\" That song was a cross-over hit comparable to The Beastie Boys' \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\" which some believe pays homage to the now-rare old-school rap style. A few of the songs done on this album portray a more personal side of Jay-Z; for example, \"Moment of Clarity\" sheds light on his feelings towards his estranged father and coping with his death. It also deals with accusations that he sold out to reach a wider audience. \"What More Can I Say\" addresses the \"biting\" accusations with which many critics have impugned him.\n\nIn 2004, there was a runaway hit remix project by DJ Danger Mouse called The Grey Album in which Jay-Z's Black Album vocals were blended with instrumentals sampled exclusively from The Beatles' White Album (which subsequently embroiled the DJ in a lawsuit that was later dropped with EMI, the owner's to the Beatles' work). This was made possible by an a cappella version of the \"Black Album\" that Jay-Z released with the specific intent for others to mix. The success of \"The Grey Album\" led to a rainbow of Black Album remix projects including \"The Red Album\", \"The Blue Album\" and so forth.\n\nAlso in 2004, Jay-Z collaberated with the triple platinum selling band, Linkin Park. The project was named Collision Course, and contained a six track EP, as well as a making of DVD. Some of the mash ups tracks were entitled Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You, Jigga What/Faint, and Numb/Encore.\n\nJay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006 titled Kingdom Come. Jay-Z's comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate. Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features producers such as Just Blaze, Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin. This album has sold more than 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Jay-Z made a guest appearance on the Fall Out Boy album Infinity On High. Jay-Z appeared on rapper T.I.'s album T.I. vs. T.I.P. on the song \"Watch What You Say to Me\".\n\nJay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the film, he was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler. The album features production from Diddy & The Hitmen, Just Blaze, and The Neptunes, among others. Guest appearances include Beanie Sigel, Lil Wayne, and Nas. The album sold 425,861 copies in it's first week and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nRecent years\n\nIt was announced on February 2, 2008, that Jay-Z would headline the 2008 Glastonbury Festival, becoming the first major hip hop artist to headline the British festival. Tickets sold out before the opening of the festival. One of the more outspoken critics of his selection was Noel Gallagher of Oasis fame, who criticized the organizers of the festival for scheduling Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival, stating \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong.\"\n\nControversy ensued in the months leading up to the event with artists, promoters and fans weighing in both for and against. Jay-Z responded to this saying, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\" In response to Gallagher's criticism, Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\". His Glastonbury performance was heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.\n\nHe also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London. During Kanye West's August 6, 2008 concert at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and Kanye proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company and also partnered up with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc. Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009, but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation. Its international release followed on September 14. It is his 11th album to reach No.1 on the Billboard 200 and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo artist record holder.\n\nOn October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009. At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the very first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produced the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.\n\nJay-Z performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2010.\nOn January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon. In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue. Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December. He also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also joined the band for a performance of \"Scarlet\", singing some lines of his song, \"History\". In August 2010, it was revealed that Jay-Z and Kanye West would be collaborating on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne. Although, it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z. The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to it being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record, until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling only 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the US Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. In April 2011, Jay-Z launched a blog-like, lifestyle website by the name of Life + Times. It covers everything from music, to fashion, to technology, to sports. The site is curated based on Jay-Z's interests, and he himself works with a small staff to produce every single piece of content.\n\nJay-Z collaborated with M.I.A. on the single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter announced that Jay-Z will be the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance will be produced by Live Nation and will assemble an eclectic lineup of “rock, hip hop, R&B, latin music and dance” musicians. Jay-Z and Rihanna are to be the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24. Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single for the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean star alongside Jay-Z in the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold out show at The Barclays Center On October 6, 2012.[91] On November 12, 2012 Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.\n\nOn September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011. The album has not yet been released; it has been confirmed 3 songs have been recorded and one of which features Frank Ocean. In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z is working on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. In an interview with XXL, Beats stated: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he’s working on. I don’t even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven’t even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, ‘Yo, I’ma go in on this,’ or, ‘I like this.’” The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV and XXL Magazine. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single Suit & Tie from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[97] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced that his twelfth studio album would be titled, Magna Carta... Holy Grail and would be released on July 4, 2013. He has been in the studio with various artists such as Drake, Nas, and Justin Timberlake working on the album.[98] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist. Jay-Z appeared on his Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.\n\nTechnique\n\nIn his earliest appearances, Jay-Z's style was less polished; he had a propensity for rhyming fast, which gradually lessened over the years. By 1996, he had become more known for his metaphors and similes, as well as being a rapper to stress the ordeals of the drug-dealer's life. Later, flow would become a big part of his style.\n\nHe has often pointed to his ability to switch from emotionally provocative material like \"Song Cry\" to mainstream topics, such as \"Big Pimpin\", as a sign that he straddles a line between material and intelligent rhymes that not a lot of artists have been able to do. However, he has been criticized for selling out to reach a mainstream audience, and he has acknowledged this on the song \"Moment of Clarity\".\n\nRecently, producers and artists alike have been praising Jay-Z's ability to create verse after verse completely in his head without the aid of a pen and paper. His ability to memorize and recite verbatim line after line of lyrics is praised.\n\nRetirement\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert at Madison Square Garden, which would later be the focus of his film Fade to Black. This concert was his \"retirement party.\" All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators like The Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyonce, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell and R. Kelly with special appearances by Violetta Wallace and Afeni Shakur; the mothers of Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur respectively.\n\nWhile Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, mash-up projects and concert appearances with R. Kelly, Linkin Park and Phish. These appearances have kept Jay's name in the spotlight and furthered peoples' speculation that he would not remain retired for long.\n\nJay-Z was the executive producer of Fort Minor's debut album The Rising Tied. Mike Shinoda got together with Jay-Z himself, as well as his Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson, and they went over what tracks they thought should make the album. Some of the tracks on the album include Remember The Name, Petrified, Believe Me, Where'd You Go and Right Now.\n\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z performed a show at Radio City Music Hall on June 25th, 2006 and a rehearsal show at New York's Nokia Theatre one day prior. These shows will be followed by a world tour in September, calling at various cities throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. While locations for the tour have been confirmed, no dates have yet been given apart from 4 dates in the UK and 1 in Ireland.\n\n\"I Declare War\" concert\n\nHaving been such a visible artist in the late '90s through the early 2000s, Jay has been the subject of more rap-related controversy than most artists in mainstream hip-hop. Some of these have been resolved, some are ongoing, and some have simply dissipated.\n\nOn October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" Concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event to whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war on. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay upon his rivals. However, an anticipated response to subliminal shots taken by The Game and Cam'ron never materialized.\n\nThe theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as President and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Rocafella records artists, Ne-Yo, Teairra Mari, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, the LOX, and P. Diddy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many beefs to rest to the surprise of hip-hop fans. Instead of declaring war, he declared that he was the \"United Nations of this rap shit.\" The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous beef between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas's song \"The World is Yours,\" from which \"Dead Presidents\" had sampled the vocals on the chorus. (Nas's verses were rapped over the \"Dead Presidents\" beat in the vein of a mix song done by DJ Statik Selektah.) Nas later performed songs of his own.\n\nBeefs between other artists were also brought to a close (or put on hold) at the Powerhouse show. The event brought together for the first time in years, P. Diddy and The LOX, both who had a longstanding animosity due to a contract agreement between P. Diddy and The Lox and the latter's departure from Bad Boy Entertainment. Shortly after the concert, the beef was fully rectified.\n\nThe event also saw the return of Beanie Sigel from incarceration. There had been some speculation that Beanie Sigel was going to depart from Rocafella Records, but this concert proved otherwise. Beanie and The LOX's Jadakiss also officially ended their own beef when they, Jay-Z, the rest of the LOX and Sauce Money (who had been thought to have some animosity towards Jay) all performed the song \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\nHip-Hop entrepreneur\n\nApart from being former President and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, Jay-Z is also one of the owners and founders of the Roc-A-Fella empire, which includes Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc-La-Familia, Roc-A-Fella Films and Rocawear.\n\nAt heart, Jay-Z is an entrepreneur like his fellow hip-hop-moguls-turned-friends Russell Simmons and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who also have business holdings such as record companies and clothing lines. He redirected the hip hop culture from hooded sweatshirts and baggy jeans to button-ups and crisp jeans, and received GQ's International Man of the Year award.\n\nRoc-A-Fella Records\n\nJay-Z co-founded Roc-A-Fella Records with partners Damon Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke. Def Jam purchased a 50% stake in the company in 1997 for a reported $1.5 million.\n\nIn late 2004, Jay-Z, Dame Dash and Biggs sold their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and the label was retained as an Island Def Jam imprint. Soon thereafter Jay-Z was appointed the new President and CEO of Def Jam Recordings by Island Def Jam chairman L.A. Reid. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreement between Jay-Z and Dash as to what new ventures Roc-A-Fella could undertake.\n\nThe publicized split between Jay, Dash and Biggs led to the former partners sending jabs at each other in interviews. Dame Dash has made comment that after the break up he was portrayed as \"Osama Bin Laden\" to ensure that rappers would stay with Jay and not sign with him. Dash currently operates the recently-founded Dame Dash Music Group as a joint venture with Island Def Jam producing former Roc-A-Fella artists such as Beanie Sigel.\n\nUniversal Music Group announced on December 24th, 2007 that Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter stepped down from his post as president of Def Jam Records. The rapper, 38, served as CEO of the historic hip hop label since 2005. He will continue to work as a solo artist under the Roc-A-Fella / Def Jam umbrella, Reuters reports. Universal did not give a reason for his departure.\n\nRocawear and fashion\n\nCo-founded in 1999 by Jay-Z, Damon Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, Rocawear designed for and sought out a share of the lucrative urban fashion market already being capitalized on by labels like Phat Farm.\n\nIn 2005, Jay-Z bought out Rocawear co-founder Dash for an estimated $30 million and has sought to expand the company's reach by developing the S. Carter high-end clothing line. Jay also has a line of Reebok sneakers aptly named The S.Carter Collection, which holds the record for fastest-selling Reebok shoe in history and made him the first non-athlete to have a signature line of sneakers. In the spring of 2006, he is in collaboration with Swiss luxury-watch maker Audemars Piguet.\n\nEntertainment and lifestyle\n\nJay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar which started in New York City and has since expanded to Atlantic City, NJ. Future plans will see 40/40 Clubs in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Singapore. Roc-A-Fella also distributes Armadale, a Scottish vodka, in the U.S.\n\nJay-Z is a part owner of the New Jersey Nets NBA team, and is one of the franchise owners interested in relocating the team to Brooklyn. In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering a takeover of Arsenal F.C., an English football team.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCriminal charges\n\nJay-Z was accused of stabbing record executive Lance \"Un\" Riviera for what he perceived was Riveria's bootlegging of Vol 3...Life and Times of S. Carter. The stabbing allegedly occurred at the record release party for Q-Tip's debut solo album Amplified at the Kit Kat Klub, a now defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, on December 9, 1999. Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover when he supposedly stabbed Riviera in the stomach with a five-inch blade.\n\nJay-Z initially denied the incident and pled not guilty when a grand jury returned the indictment. Jay-Z and his lawyers contended he was nowhere around Riviera during the incident and they had witnesses and videotape evidence from the club that showed Jay-Z's whereabouts during the disturbance. Nevertheless, he later pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge which resulted in a sentence of three months probation. The New York Post reported that Jay-Z had bought out Riviera for $600,000 to cease his cooperation with prosecutors, and without the cooperation of the victim, prosecutors had to cut a plea deal that would not interfere with Jay-Z's touring plans. Riviera also dropped a civil suit, where he asked for $40 million.\n\nJay-Z makes reference to the trial and incident on his songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", off The Blueprint, and \"Dear Summer\", which was included in Memphis Bleek's 2005 release 534.\n\nRival rapper Cam'ron has since claimed on his song \"You Gotta Love It\" that Jay-Z had actually \"stabbed Un over Charli Baltimore\". Some media moguls have criticized Jay-Z for not fulfilling his position as a role model due to these incidents.\n\nRomantic life\n\nJay-Z is married to American R&B singer Beyoncé. In 2002, Jay-Z and Beyoncé collaborated for the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". Jay-Z also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single \"Crazy in Love\" and as well as \"That's How You Like It\" from her debut Dangerously in Love. On her second album,  B'Day, he made appearances on the 2006 hits, \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance. The couple generally avoid discussing their relationship. Beyoncé has stated that she believes that not publicly discussing their relationship has helped them. Jay-Z said in a People article, \"We don't play with our relationship.\" They kept a low profile while dating, and married quietly in April 2008. It became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008, but Beyoncé did not publicly debut her $5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008 in New York City.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2006. In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple. They also made it to the top of the list the following year.\n\nOn January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their daughter, named Blue Ivy Carter. On January 9, 2012, Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to their child, on his social website LifeandTimes.com.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Robyn Rihanna Fenty, known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Barbadian singer, actress, and businesswoman.\n\nShe has attained fourteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados. In 2021 Rihanna was named a \"National Hero\" in her home country, earning her the title \"The Right Excellent.\" \n\nRihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.\n\nAt the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that \"the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of \"Emotion\".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad \"The Last Time,\" a cover of Whitney Houston’s hit \"For the Love of You\" and what would become her first hit, \"Pon de Replay\" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.\n\nRihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single \"Pon de Replay\".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released album artist=Rihanna]A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, \"SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track \"Tainted Love\".  \"Unfaithful\" was also released and was fairly successful.\n\nRihanna released her third album Good Girl Gone Bad in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, \"I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].\"\n\nThe album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.\n\nIt yielded eight hit singles - \"Umbrella\"  \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Don't Stop The Music\" \"Hate That I Love You\" \"Rehab\" \"Disturbia\" \"Take A Bow\" \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit \"Umbrella,\" featuring Jay-Z.  \n\nIn addition to reaching number one in various countries, \"Umbrella\" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.\n\n\"Umbrella\" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press.

The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed \"Run This Town\" along with Jay-Z and West for the \"Answer the Call\" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown.

        "content": "Edward Christopher \"Ed\" Sheeran MBE (born 17 February 1991) is a singer songwriter currently signed under Atlantic (WMG).  Ed Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire before moving to Framlingham, Suffolk. In his time in Suffolk, he was known to have flourished as a hidden talent when it came to music. He learned guitar at a very young age, and began writing songs during his time at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham. By the time Sheeran had left school, he was already certain that music was going to play a major part in his life, and therefore studied at Access To Music in Norwich before moving to London which improved his chances of getting gigs.\n\nSheeran began recording in 2005, which lead to the release of his first EP, The Orange Room EP. Sheeran also released two albums, a self titled one in 2006 and Want Some? in 2007 gaining little attention. After Sheeran moved to London and had done extensive gigging, performing songs from his EP and albums, as well as ones which he had recently written, he decided to release another EP, You Need Me in late 2009. However, it wasn't until February 2010 that Sheeran began to get noticed after he posted a video through SB.tv displaying his diverse style. This video led to mainstream rapper Example asking Sheeran to tour with him. Throughout 2010, Sheeran began to be seen by more and more people over the internet through [app] YouTube and his fan-base grew incredibly, with him also getting credit from The Independent newspaper, England football captain Rio Ferdinand and even Elton John. Sheeran released three EP's in 2010, Loose Change, which features one of his most known songs, \"The A Team\", Songs I Wrote With Amy, and Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford, a live EP recorded in October. During the year, Sheeran also went to the US, where he was discovered by international superstar Jamie Foxx, who asked Sheeran to perform on his radio show, which gained him some fans in the US. By the end of the year, Sheeran was seen to be one of the best unsigned artists in the country. \nOn 9 January 2011, Sheeran released his final independent EP, No.5 Collaborations Project featuring appearances by grime artists including Wiley, JME, Devlin and Ghetts. With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for reaching number 2 in the iTunes chart, without any promotion or label. He was listed as a 'special guest' on Devlin's 2011 'Bud, Sweat and Beers' mini tour alongside Griminal and Tinchy Stryder. Songfacts reports that after signing for Atlantic Records in January 2011 \"The A Team\" was released as the first single from his debut album on June 12, 2011.\n\nSheeran's debut album + containing the singles The A Team and Lego House is certified 6x Platinum in the UK. The album has also won Sheeran two Brit Awards for British Breakthrough Act and Best British Male Solo Artist. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sheeran gained a nomination for Best New Artist. \n\nHe received further fame for contributing the track entitled \"I See Fire\" to Howard Shore's soundtrack to the movie \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\" in 2013.\n\nx the second studio album by Sheeran was released in 2015. The album went straight to number one in both the UK and the US. x has had five singles thus far Sing, Don't, Thinking Out Loud, Bloodstream and Photograph.\n\nSheeran recently was awarded with an Honorary Doctorate by the University Campus Suffolk (UCS).

        "content": "There are multiple artists tracked as \"Nirvana\" on Last.fm. Following are six, listed in order of prominence:\n\n1) Nirvana was a popular and highly influential American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.\n\nIn late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of \"Love Buzz\", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.\n\nAt the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.\n\nIn early 1993, Nirvana released \"Puss\"/\"Oh, the Guilt\", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. \n\nAs Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.\n\nNirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, \"You Know You're Right\", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, the box set \"With the Lights Out\", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, \"Sliver: The Best Of The Box\" was released, a compilation of selected \"WTLO\" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous \"Fecal Matter\" demo.\n\nBand members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)\n\nPrior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)\n\nTouring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)\n\n---\n\n2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.\n\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably \"Rainbow Chaser\", \"Pentecost Hotel\", and \"Tiny Goddess\") for the fledgling Island Records label.\n\nThe band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. \n\nIn October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September 1969).\n\nMusically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.\n\nThe next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.\n\nIn 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.\n\nThe band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song \"Lithium\" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.\n\nIn 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled \"Chemistry\" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.\n\nTop musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.\n\nThe group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of \"progressive rock, soft rock or \"orchestral pop\".\n\nTheir first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.\n\nAs of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.\n\n---\n\n3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7\" vinyl with tracks \"Kielletyt leikit\" and \"Kuljen kaupungilla\" with 200 pressings.\n\n---\n\n4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits and Annie Alberti and have released one single, \"Say When\", which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.\n\n---\n\n5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters' James Ferraro. Primitive droning drum beats and swirling synthesizers.\n\n---\n\n6) Nirvana was a Slovenian hard-rock band in the early seventies. They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Calvin Harris (born Adam Richard Wiles; January 17,  1984 in Dumfries, Scotland), is a Scottish singer, songwriter and record producer. He was born and grew up in Dumfries, Scotland. His interest in electronic music surfaced in his early teenage years, producing his first bedroom demo by the age of 15. \n\nHis first album I Created Disco was released on 18 June 2007. The album contained up-tempo electroclash songs that were influenced by music from the 1980s. To promote 'I Created Disco', Harris embarked on a tour of the UK, supporting Faithless and Groove Armada.\n\nThe first release from the album was Vegas on limited edition vinyl and the first charted single released from the album was Acceptable In The 80's, a tribute to the style and culture of the decade. The song reached the top ten on the UK singles chart, remaining on the chart for fifteen weeks. The Girls was the album's second charted single. The fourth release from the album was Merrymaking At My Place however it only reached #43 in the UK chart.\n\n'Merrymaking At My Place' caused Harris some un-needed press, as the song and video promoted filming parties at teenagers' houses, and placing them on Youtube.\n\nHarris' second studio album Ready For The Weekend was released on August 17, 2009 in the United Kingdom. The first single, I'm Not Alone, was exclusively performed in Sydney, on New Year's Eve. The single was released in April 2009. The new single debuted on BBC Radio 1 on Friday 23 January 2009, on the 'Pete Tong' radio show. The song featured on his MySpace with the infamous spoiler, which repeated the phrase 'I Am Your Nan' in a robotic voice. It debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #1 on Easter Sunday on downloads alone. \n\nHarris rose to international prominence in 2012 with the release of his third studio album, 18 Months. Topping the UK charts, the album became his first to chart on the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 19. All eight of the album's singles; \"Bounce\", \"Let's Go\", \"We'll Be Coming Back\", \"Sweet Nothing\", \"Drinking from the Bottle\", \"I Need Your Love\", \"Thinking About You\" and \"Feel So Close\", along with \"We Found Love\" reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Harris]\n\nHarris has collaborated with numerous other recording artists, including Kylie Minogue, Rita Ora, John Newman, Florence Welch, Ellie Goulding, Ne-Yo, Cheryl Cole and Gwen Stefani. His collaboration with Rihanna led to two singles, \"Where Have You Been\" and \"We Found Love\". The latter became an international success, giving Harris his first US number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Harris released his fourth studio album, Motion, in November 2014. It debuted at at number two in the UK and number five in the US, and became Harris's second consecutive number-one album on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart. The album's first three singles—\"Under Control\", \"Summer\" and \"Blame\"—all topped the UK chart. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Harris]\n\nHarris holds the record for the most top 10 hits from one studio album on the UK Singles Chart with nine hits, surpassing Michael Jackson. In October 2014, he became the first artist to place three songs simultaneously on the top 10 of Billboard's Dance/Electronic Songs chart. He also became the first British solo artist to reach more than one billion streams on Spotify. Harris has received seven Brit Award nominations—two for Best British Male, and four Grammy nominations, winning a Grammy for Best Music Video in 2013. He received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year in 2013 and at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards was named Top Dance/Electronic Artist. Harris also runs his own record label Fly Eye Records. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Harris]\n\nForbes began reporting on Harris's earnings in 2013, calculating that he earned $46 million between May 2012 and May 2013, for his music, tour and his residency in Las Vegas which placed him as the highest-paid DJ of the year. In 2014, Harris came in at number one on the list again for the second consecutive year with a total of $66 million in annual earnings. In 2015, Harris topped the highest-paid DJs list for a third consecutive year, having earned $66 million over the previous 12 months. On The Sunday Times Rich List published in April 2015, Harris was ranked the 30th richest British millionaire in music, with a personal fortune of £70 million ($105 million). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Harris]\n\n In February 2015, Harris started dating American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. By June 2015, the duo were ranked as the highest-paid celebrity couple in music over the past year by Forbes with combined earnings of over $146 million.

        "content": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, and actor.\n\nEminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States. Throughout his career, he has had 10 number-one albums on the Billboard 200 and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. With more than 47.4 million albums and 107.5 million singles sold in the US and 220 million records globally, he is among the world's best-selling artists of all time and is consistently cited as one of the greatest and most influential artists in any genre. He is the only artist to have eight albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling him  \"King of Hip-Hop\".\n\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996) and then Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with [album artist= Eminem The Slim Shady LP[/album], which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LPand 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in U.S. sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, the second time he had the international best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15. In 2017, he released his ninth studio album, Revival. On August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album, Kamikaze, to streaming services Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music.\n\nIn addition to his solo career, Eminem is an original member of the Midwest hip hop groups Soul Intent and D12. He is also known for his collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9\"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent. Eminem has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, he starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", becoming the first rap artist to ever win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010). \n\nMarshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" Nelson. His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California and having two other children: Michael and Sarah. Debbie later had son Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara. During his childhood, Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Michigan and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City.\n\nEminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP. In this persona his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.\n\nAs a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and as a lyricist and as aforementioned to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him, which he took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\".\n\nComing up from Detroit's rap battle scene, Eminem proved he could withstand the test of time to become one of the greatest and best-selling artists in hip-hop. The lackluster debut of Infinite in 1996 ignited his Slim Shady violent persona, whom Em debuted in Slim Shady EP in 1997. Somehow, Dr. Dre got a copy of the EP, and well, the rest is history. Since then, many other great rappers have listed Eminem as one of their influences while growing up. From Detroit's very own Big Sean to Compton's finest Kendrick Lamar, here's how Eminem influenced the style of some of these rappers. \n\nBig Sean:\nComing from the Motor City of Detroit, Big Sean grew up with Eminem's The Slim Shady LP tape. The two ended up collaborating several times, including in Detroit's posse cut \"Detroit vs. Everybody\" from Shady XV album.\n\n\"He’s the biggest rapper of all time,\" the rapper told Tim Westwood of Capital Xtra, citing the album as one of his childhood favorites. “If you just look at the numbers. You can imagine what that’s like coming up in Detroit and looking up to that.\"\n\nB.o.B:\nNorth Carolina rapper B.o.B rose to stardom in the early 2010s after his Bruno Mars-supported single \"Nothin' on You\" scored a massive commercial success. He's also won an Eminem feature in \"Airplanes\" from The Adventures of Bobby Ray debut album.\n\n\"I grew up listening to Eminem, so to be able to work and get advice on your music from him is a dream come true,\" he told MTV.\n\nTyler, The Creator:\nWhile the two had exchanged some not-so-nice words about each other between 2017 and 2018, one of Tyler the Creator's favorite albums of all time is Eminem's 2009 Relapse. The drug-fueled and heavy-accented album plays a serial killer role, which Tyler's early works were heavily influenced by. Some of his favorite songs from the horrorcore album were \"Stay Wide Awake,\" \"Deja Vu,\" \"Underground,\" and \"Hello.\"\n\nLogic:\nLogic hailed Eminem as one of his all-time favorites, but it wasn't until 2019 that they finally linked up. The two collaborated for \"Homicide\" from Logic's Confession of a Dangerous Mind album.\n\n\"Em, if you’re reading this I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you. I’ll never forget the experience and I’m more than happy and ecstatic to now call you my homie!,\" the rapper took to social media to detail his encounter with the Rap God.\n\nMac Miller:\nThe late Mac Miller grew up with the angst and explosive anger of The Marshall Mathers LP, but it wasn't until he turned 15 or 16 that he finally realized the genius of Em.\n\n\"I think people assume that that was how I got into rap, by the way of like Marshall Mathers LP. Had some good moments with that when I was younger,\" The Divine Feminine rapper told Mass Appeal's Time Alone.\n\nXXXTentacion:\nIf there's something that Eminem and XXXTentacion have shared in common, is that the two are bravely candid about their struggle with substance abuse in their early works. In fact, when the train of hate started coming towards Em in 2017 for \"Walk on Water\" from Revival, X is one of the few people who defended the single.\n\nJuice WRLD:\nComing up from the rap battle scene, Eminem's freestyling ability should not be put in question. The late Juice WRLD did an hour non-stop freestyle over Eminem's classic beats at Tim Westwood. The two ended up collaborating for Juice's first-ever posthumous feature, \"Godzilla,\" from Eminem's Music to Be Murdered By album in 2020.\n\n\"That kid was so talented,\" Eminem showed the late some love during a rare chat on King Crookxd's Crooked Corner interview series. \"To be so young, he mastered that so f—ing quickly. His potential was so off the charts.\"\n\nNicki Minaj:\nOver the years, Eminem and Nicki Minaj have shared a unique timeline of friendship and name-dropped each other in their respective crafts. Both are fans of each other's works, with Nicki Minaj listing Em as one of her all-time favorites.\n\n\"As a fan of rap, I think I would say the people that have influenced me the most with the way I rap, that would definitely be Lil Wayne, JAY-Z, Foxy Brown, Eminem,\" she told XXL.\n\nJ. Cole:\nJ. Cole always shows love for Eminem. Interestingly, he also cited rap veteran Canibus, one of Eminem's early nemesis, as another inspiration. His favorite album was The Marshall Mathers LP.\n\n\"I have people's raps on my wall, but his raps and then Canibus' raps were the only ones that could get close to the bedspread,\" he told DJ Whoo Kid in an interview.\n\nKendrick Lamar:\nJust like Eminem back in the late 1990s, in the early 2010s, Kendrick Lamar also signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label. In fact, this trio link-up is what propelled \"Kung Fu Kenny's\" career to the next level.\n\nThe \"King Kunta\" rapper spoke highly of Eminem and often called him one of his favorites. Em's aggressiveness in The Marshall Mathers LP influenced Lamar's hard-hitting and determined approach in his early works, especially in his 2013 verse in Big Sean's cut \"Control\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\nGorillaz is a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. Canonically speaking, Murdoc Niccals formed the band. The band currently consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Noodle (guitar, vocals), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through animated music videos, interviews, and animated shorts. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, and often collaborates with other musicians.\n\nThe roots of Gorillaz can be traced back to 1990, when guitarist Graham Coxon asked cartoonist Jamie Hewlett to interview his newly formed band,  Blur. Coxon knew of Hewlett's work drawing the Tank Girl comic strip in Deadline magazine. When Jamie first met the band's lead singer Damon Albarn, the two did not hit it off well. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \"arsey\" and \"a wanker,\" but the two remained acquainted and would eventually become roommates in 1997, living in London. \n\nBoth  Jamie and Damon tell the story of Gorillaz came to be about the same way. They were in their flat watching TV, specifically MTV, and came up with the idea of a \"virtual band\" as commentary on the vapidity of popular music at the turn of the millennium. Previously the best-known '\"cartoon bands\" were animated versions of The Monkees and The Beatles that kids could watch on Saturday mornings. But Gorillaz (initially called just \"Gorilla\") was to be an ambitious musical project with eclectic, genre-bending tunes,  unique visuals, and a detailed backstory for how the virtual band came to be. \n\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct  Britpop of Blur and explored influences including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an \"eccentrically postmodern\" approach. The band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies worldwide. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was withdrawn at the band's request. Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, and has sold over eight million copies worldwide. The band has won other awards, including one Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and three MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nThe third Gorillaz studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. The fourth, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. In 2017, after a five-year hiatus, Gorillaz announced their fifth studio album Humanz. Their sixth studio album, The Now Now, was released on 29 June 2018. Gorillaz have been nominated for ten Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.\n\nThe Gorillaz characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.\n\nThey have released five studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (Also in 2010) and Humanz (2017). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website. Their sixth studio album The Now Now is set to be released on June 29th, 2018.\n\nThe band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken for a full-time band member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator of Deltron 3030.\n\nAt the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single would find its way onto the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.\n\nTheir second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Mañana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album – produced by Dj Danger Mouse – include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of the Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, Roots Manuva, and Martina Topley-Bird, among others.  DARE – the first Gorillaz track featuring lead vocals by Noodle – reached #1 in the UK charts.\n\nIn late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, \"I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Bashy,  Kano, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. \n\nA 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 & 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 & 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).\n\nSince the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said \"Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.\"\n\nAlbarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.\n\nThe duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a \"Journey to the East\", with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. \n\nGorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.\n\nAt the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It was, when released, the first album to be recorded entirely on an iPad. The album was made available for free to Gorillaz fan club members for a limited time as a digital download – and hard copies were released to worldwide markets in the following year.\n\nIn April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were \"unlikely\".  However, it was later announced by the duo that they had reconciled their difference – and that Noodle, Russel, Murdoc and 2-D would return with a new album in 2017.  Featuring collaborations by artists such as album Grace Jones, Kali Uchis, Popcaan, Vince Staples, Mavis Staples, Peven Everett, Pusha T, Kelela, Jamie Principle, D.R.A.M. and Graham Coxon, Humanz was released to critical acclaim; the album would go on to win Gorillaz the 2018 Brit Award for Best British Group.  Gorillaz would also collaborate with Carly Simon, Kilo Kish and Rag'n'Bone Man on the Deluxe edition of Humanz, while Little Simz would feature on the single Garage Palace.  Another 2017 release was the single Sleeping Powder – supposedly written and recorded in a day.  Meanwhile, a solar energy-themed collaboration with E.ON, released in 2017, would later win Gorillaz a Webby Award.  \n\nA new album, The Now Now, would follow in 2018.  Written by Albarn whilst touring Humanz – and featuring two collaborations, including the return of Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle as well as George Benson and Graham Coxon – The Now Now spawned six singles, including Humility, Tranz, and Lake Zürich.  Murdoc was unable to enjoy the band's success for the time being as he was undergoing a stint in jail for an undisclosed malefaction; he was replaced on bass for Ace Copular – who most famously played Ace of the Gangreen Gang in the Powerpuff Girls TV series – for the recording of The Now Now; however, Murdoc would later break his way out of prison.  Gorillaz saw the year out by securing another Brits nomination for Best British Group as well as winning a second consecutive Webby Award; this time, for the FreeMurdoc chatbot, which provided a way for Gorillaz fans to interact with Murdoc Niccals during his incarceration. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, musician, and dancer. He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of musical styles, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock. Mars is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums, and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers.\n\nBorn and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. In 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. He rose to fame in 2010 buoyed by the success of \"Nothin' on You\" by B.o.B and \"Billionaire\" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals. That year, Mars released his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which blended pop with reggae pop and R&B. It spawned the international number-one singles \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", and \"The Lazy Song\". Drawing inspiration from disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second studio album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), was his first number one on the Billboard 200. It amassed two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits, \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"When I Was Your Man\".\n\nIn 2014, Mars was featured on Mark Ronson's \"Uptown Funk\", which topped various music charts, spending a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Mars's third studio album, the R&B-focused, 24K Magic (2016), received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The album also yielded the top-five singles \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", his seventh Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, and a remix of \"Finesse\" featuring Cardi B. In 2021, Mars collaborated with Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic on the full-length album An Evening with Silk Sonic, whose single \"Leave the Door Open\" topped the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMars has sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has released eight number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 since his career launched in 2010, attaining his first five faster than any male artist since Elvis Presley. Mars became the first artist to receive five diamond certified songs in the United States. He was included in Music Week and Billboard magazine as one of the best songwriters of 2011 and 2013, respectively. Mars has received several awards and nominations, including 11 Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine American Music Awards, 10 Soul Train Awards and holds three Guinness world records. He appeared in Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, Forbes magazine's list of \"30 Under 30\" in 2013, and Forbes's Celebrity 100 in 2014, 2018, and 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986) is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.\n\nDrake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, \"One Dance\", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.\n\nViews achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single \"Hotline Bling\" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song. In 2017, he released the \"playlist\" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single \"God's Plan\", and the bounce-infused number one singles \"Nice for What\" and \"In My Feelings\".\n\nAmong the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.\n\nEarly life\nDrake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.\nAubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.\n\nDrake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled \"Drake's Dad\". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.\n\nDrake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, \"[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.\"\n\nHe attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as \"not by any means the easiest school to go to.\" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.\n\nCareer - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation\nAt 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, \"My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV\". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.\n\n2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone\nLil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.\nAfter becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as \"pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it.\" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single \"Replacement Girl\", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with \"Replacement Girl\" being featured on the channel's \"New Joint of the Day\" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample \"Man of the Year\" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including \"Ransom\", \"Forever\", and a remix to \"Brand New\". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.\n\nIn 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Successful\", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs \"I'm Goin' In\" and \"Fear\". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.\n\nDue to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as \"one of the biggest bidding wars ever\". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.\n\nDrake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of \"Best I Ever Had\" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.\n\n2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care\nDrake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single \"Over\", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, \"Find Your Love\", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, \"]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image].\" The third single and fourth singles, \"Miss Me\" and \"Fancy\" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.\n\nIt was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.\n\nBeginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah \"40\" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, \"I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round.\" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.\n\nIn January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. \"Dreams Money Can Buy\" and \"Marvins Room\" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while \"Marvins Room\" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.\n\n\"Headlines\" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. \"Make Me Proud\" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. \"Make Me Proud\" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.\n\nPrior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.\n\nTake Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it \"an affecting masterpiece\" and commended its \"delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics.\" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's \"technical abilities\" to be improved and stated, \"Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up.\" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it \"a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West.\" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's \"moral psychodramas\" and stated, \"the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power.\" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.\n\nThe album's third and fourth singles, \"The Motto\" and Take Care\", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with \"The Motto\" credited for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States. The music video for \"Take Care\" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, \"None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it.\" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's \"Pop Songs You Must Hear\" list of 2011. \"HYFR\" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their \"Hottest MCs in the Game\" list.\n\nIn promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.\n\n2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes\nDuring the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.\n\nIn January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, \"Hold On, We're Going Home\", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, \"Too Much\", alongside featured artist Sampha.\n\nNothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the \"Would You like a Tour?\" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what \"kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters\". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.\n\nIn 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the \"Hot 100\", and released \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.\n\nOn February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.\n\nWhat a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.\n\n2016–2017: Views and More Life\nDrake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single \"Summer Sixteen\" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. \"Summer Sixteen\" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as \"goodly brash\" or \"conventionally disrespectful.\" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term \"The Six\" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.\n\nDrake soon released the album's lead singles, \"Pop Style\" and the dancehall-infused \"One Dance\", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with \"One Dance\" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, \"One Dance\" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.\n\n\nDrake performing at the Summer Sixteen Tour in Toronto in 2016.\nViews was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.\n\nDrake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for \"Child's Play\" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.\n\nSoon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a \"playlist of original music\", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.\n\nHe then released the single \"Signs\" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with \"Signs\" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the \"Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018\" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.\n\n2018: Scorpion and return to television\nAfter rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song \"Family Feud\" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs \"Diplomatic Immunity\" and \"God's Plan\", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.\n\nDrake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song \"Walk It Talk It\", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, \"Look Alive\", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to \"Lemon\", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, \"Nice for What\" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.\n\nAfter \"Nice For What\" replaced his own \"God's Plan\" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released \"I'm Upset\" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nShortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with \"In My Feelings\" on July 21, which also spawned the viral \"#InMyFeelingsChallenge\" or \"#KiKiChallenge\". The success of \"In My Feelings\" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for \"Nonstop\", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.\n\nHe then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song \"Sicko Mode\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to \"take 6 months to a year\" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled \"Mia\", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.\n\n2019–present: Upcoming album\nIn February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for \"God's Plan\", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating \"a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,\" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.\n\nOn February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song \"Girls Need Love\", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single \"No Guidance\". On June 15, Drake released two songs, \"Omertà\" and \"Money in the Grave\", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.\n\nArtistry - influences\nDrake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his \"biggest inspirations\".\n\nMusical style\nDrake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as \"ting\", \"touching road\", \"talkin' boasy\" and \"gwanin' wassy\". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.\n\nThe lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating \"degrading\" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between \"pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata.\" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as \"hyper-reality rap\", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the \"real world.\"\n\nPublic image\nThe Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States, with his single, \"The Motto\", which includes, \"You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO.\" Drake later popularized the term \"The Six\" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared \"Drake Day\" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single \"God's Plan\" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then \"kept up the spending spree\" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.\n\nThe music video for \"Hotline Bling\" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for \"Hotline Bling\". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6\" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the \"Air Jordan OVOs\". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as \"[one of] the most stylish men alive\".\n\nControversies - legal issues\nIn 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on \"Marvins Room\". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling \"Jimmy Smith Rap\", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on \"Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2\", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song \"Who Do You Love?\". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.\n\nIn 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel \"Chubbs\" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.\n\nFeuds\nDrake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.\n\nIn December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on \"6 God\" and \"6PM in New York\", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.\n\nFurther controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for \"RICO\", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for \"R.I.C.O.\". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for \"R.I.C.O.\", \"10 Bands\", and \"Know Yourself\". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled \"Charged Up\" and \"Back to Back\", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with \"Wanna Know\", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated \"Free Meek Mill\" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on \"Family Feud\". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on \"Infrared\" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the \"Duppy Freestyle\" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through \"The Story of Adidon\" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to \"The Story of Adidon\".\n\nIn 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through \"4PM in Calabasas\", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on \"No Shopping\" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on \"Two Birds, One Stone\" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.\n\nIn mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to \"be Quincy Jones\" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake \"felt a genuine vibe\" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to \"Lift Yourself\", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to \"give [Drake] beats\". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake \"[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music\", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song \"March 14\", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release \"Lift Yourself\", and produce \"Infrared\"; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.\n\nDrake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.\n\nBusiness ventures - Endorsements\nPrior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships \"combined heavily\" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.\n\nMain article: OVO Sound\nDuring the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah \"40\" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.\n\nDrake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nToronto Raptors\nOn September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual \"Drake Night\" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.\n\nApple Music\nFollowing the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.\n\nVirginia Black\nTwo months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as \"fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.\"\n\nThe product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the \"Virginia Black VIP Lounge\" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of \"The Realest Dude Ever\" (in reference toward \"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.\n\nPersonal life\nDrake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.\n\nDrake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits \"Take Me to the River\", \"Love and Happiness\", and \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\".\n\nDrake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.\n\nDrake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said \"she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old.\" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:\n\nAs life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Drake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While a disk jockey, he performs as mcDJ. He first came to attention for his work with Derrick Comedy and with the help of Tina Fey, was hired at the age of 21 to become a writer for the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He later played college student Troy Barnes on the NBC sitcom Community. After several self-released albums and mixtapes, Glover signed to Glassnote Records in 2011 as Childish Gambino. He released Camp on Glassnote on November 15, 2011. His second studio album, Because the Internet, was released on December 10, 2013. Glover, Jr was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2015, Best Rap Album for Because the Internet and Best Rap Performance for his single \"3005\".\n\nGlover, Jr was born at Edwards Air Force Base, California and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. His mother, Beverly (Smith, is a retired daycare provider, and his father, Donald, Sr, is a retired postal worker. His parents also served as DeKalb County foster parents for 14 years. He was raised a Jehovah's Witness. He was voted \"Most Likely to Write for The Simpsons\" in his High School yearbook. Glover, Jr graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in dramatic writing in 2006.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, Glover, Jr was a writer for the NBC series 30 Rock where he also had occasional cameo appearances. He was presented the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the third season. Glover, Jr's stage name, Childish Gambino, came from the Wu-Tang Clan's name generator. On June 5, 2008, he released an independent album, titled Sick Boi. Glover, Jr would then become a member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, along with Dominic Dierkes, Meggie McFadden, DC Pierson, and Dan Eckman. The group wrote and starred in a feature-length film, Mystery Team, released in theaters in 2009.\n\nOn September 17, 2009, Childish Gambino released the independent album Poindexter. A pair of mixtapes, titled I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just A Rapper 2 were released, in close succession in 2010. Robert Scahill added his producing expertise helping with the majority of the tracks. The track listings for those mixtapes consist of the name of the song \"he\" raps, followed by the song he raps over. His second album, Culdesac, was set to be released on July 2, 2010, but a couple of last minute additions caused the album to be delayed for a day. The album was made available on July 3. Glover, Jr has stated in interviews that on Sick Boi and Poindexter he felt he had to hide behind gimmicks, such as pink hoodies, but with his subsequent projects, he has touched on more personal subject matter, including family, schoolyard bullying, troubled romantic relationships, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. He has disowned his 2005 album, The Younger I Get, as the too-raw ramblings of what he calls a \"decrepit.\"\n\nGlover, Jr's stand-up special aired on Comedy Central on March 19, 2010. In May 2010, a fan suggested Glover, Jr for the role of Peter Parker in the then-upcoming The Amazing Spider-Man film, encouraging his supporters to retweet the hashtag \"#donald4spiderman\". The campaign, originally started to see how far social networking could carry a message, quickly gained a large following. The call for Glover to be allowed to audition for the role was supported by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Glover, Jr was not awarded an audition and the role instead went to Andrew Garfield. He would later reveal that he was never contacted by anyone from Sony Pictures for the role. Comics writer Brian Michael Bendis, who announced an African-American version of Spider-Man a year later, said he had conceived of the character before Glover, Jr's campaign went viral. Bendis gave credit to Glover for influencing the new hero's looks for Spider-man after seeing him dressed as Spider-Man on Community (a nod to the campaign), Bendis said, \"I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.'\" Glover, Jr would later voice this incarnation of Spider-Man on the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series.\n\nGlover, Jr received the Rising Comedy Star award at the Just for Laughs festival in July 2010. Glover, Jr was featured in Gap's 2010 Holiday ad campaign. He DJs and produces electronic music under the moniker \"mcDJ\" (pronounced \"M-C-D-J\"). His music is often made available for free download via his website.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Glover, Jr released the first track off of his EP titled \"Be Alone\". He released the next track, \"Freaks and Geeks\", as well as a five-song track list, on February 11, 2011. On February 25, Glover, Jr released the dates for the IAMDONALD tour and also his very first music video for \"Freaks and Geeks\". The music video was shot by Dan Eckman, the director of the Derrick Comedy troupe. This song was later used in an Adidas commercial featuring Dwight Howard.

It was preceded by the single Baby. \n\nHe followed up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never – The Remixes, and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Bieber released his second studio album Under the Mistletoe in November 2011, when it debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200. Bieber released his third studio album Believe on June 19, 2012, and it became his fourth chart topper in the United States, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.\n\nBieber has received numerous awards, including both Artist of the Year Awards at the 2010 American Music Awards and the 2012 American Music Awards, and was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. With a global fan base, termed as \"Beliebers\", and over 40 million followers on Twitter, he was named by Forbes magazine in 2012 as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world. However, in 2013 he fell to number 9. \n\nOn the 25th of December 2013,  Bieber's second concert film biopic, called Justin Bieber's Believe, was released. As a lead-up to the film, 10 songs were released every Monday for 10 consecutive weeks. The tracks were all featured on a digital collection album tilted Journals.\n\nOn the 13th of November 2015, Justin released \"Purpose\", his most personal album to date. The album received Billboard #1's with \"Love Yourself\", \"Sorry\" and \"What Do You Mean?\", also striking a \"Top Package\" award from Billboard Touring Awards for the Purpose World Tour.\n\nBieber released his fifth studio album, Changes on February 14, 2020.\n\nDiscography:\n\n1.

        "content": "Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, CA) is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.\n\n After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\n\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–\"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's \"Bad\". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.\n\nPerry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled \"Katy Perry: Part of Me\" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\nFlorence + the Machine is a London, UK, art pop band led by singer-songwriter Florence Welch and formed in 2007.  The band consists of:  Florence Welch (vocals), Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Isabella Summers (aka Isa Machine - keyboards), Tom Monger (harp), Mark Saunders (bass, percussion), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums, backing vocals), Rusty Bradshaw (keyboard, backing vocals) and Sam White (backing vocals).  \n\nLead singer, Florence Welch, was an art-college drop-out, from Camberwell (London), who was discovered singing Motown covers in a nightclub toilet, drunk.  ”The Machine” name originated with an in-joke between Welch and Summers.  Musically, Florence + The Machine's sound is sometimes referred to as soul-inspired indie rock.  Welch grew up listening to The White Stripes and Kate Bush and says she writes metaphorical songs that are \"stories with consequences and weird morality issues.\"\n\n2008\nFlorence + The Machine's music has received praise across the British music media, especially from the BBC, who played a large part in their rise to prominence, by bringing them into the spotlight as part of \"BBC Introducing\" (a program to support unsigned artists) - firstly at South By South West (SXSW) in Austin, Texas in March 2008 and later that year (Sept 2008) the band recorded a full session for the BBC at their Maida Vale studios.\n\n2009 - 2010 - first awards and first studio album - \"Lungs\"\nAt the Brit Awards 2009, Florence + The Machine received the Critics' Choice Award at the Brits in the UK. The award was introduced in 2008 (when it was awarded to Adele) and focuses on new and emerging British talent, voted for by a panel of music industry experts.\n\nThe band's début album was \"Lungs\" (Jul 2009, Universal), preceded by third single Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) (Jun 2009, Moshi Moshi).  \"Lungs\" went on to become number one in the UK album charts in January 2010, and won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 Brits, where they performed a hugely popular collaboration, You've Got the Dirtee Love (live at The Brit Awards 2010) with Dizzee Rascal - a mix of You've Got the Love, the Candi Staton cover from \"Dog Days Are Over\" (Nov 2008, IAmSound), and Dizzee’s Dirtee Cash (Sept 2009, Dirtee Stank).\n\n2011 - second studio album - \"Ceremonials\"\nThe second album \"Ceremonials\" (31 Oct 2011, Island) - with which Welch was inspired for the title and some themes from a '70s Super 8 film of an art installation, she recalls:  \"... this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different coloured robes and masks, and it was all to do with colour, really saturated, brightly coloured pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance ...\".  The album is also influenced by hymns, poems and church bells.\n\n2012 - MTV Unplugged album - \"MTV Unplugged\"\nIn 2012, the band released a live album - \"MTV Unplugged\" (Apr 2012, Universal) - as part of the MTV Unplugged series. It was filmed in December 2011 in New York’s oldest synagogue building, Angel Orensanz Center, with the band being backed by a ten-person choir.\n\n2015 - third studio album - \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful\"\nThe band's long awaited third studio album is called \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful\". It was released on May 29, 2015 on Island Records.\n\n2018 - fourth studio album - \"High As Hope\"\nThe band's fourth studio album is called \"High As Hope\". It was released on June 29, 2018 on Republic Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Florence+%252B+the+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Cure is a band which formed in 1976 in Crawley, England, United Kingdom. The band originally consisted of Robert Smith (vocals, guitar), Porl Thompson (guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass) and Lol Tolhurst (drums), with the band's lineup overgoing several changes throughout the years and Smith remaining as the only constant member throughout the band's history. The band currently consists of Smith (vocals, guitar), Simon Gallup (bass), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards), Jason Cooper (drums) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar). The Cure has released 13 studio albums and have sold 27 million albums worldwide and are considered a major influence on alternative rock, goth rock and new wave music. \n\nThe Cure's full lineup history is as follows: Robert Smith (vocals, guitar 1976-present), Lol Tolhurst (drums, keyboards 1976-1989), Michael Dempsey (bass 1976-1979), Porl Thompson (guitar, keyboards 1976-1978, 1983-1992, 2005 -2010), Simon Gallup (bass, keyboards 1979-1982, 1985-present), Matthieu Hartley (keyboards 1979 -1980), Andy Anderson (drums 1983-1984), Phil Thornalley (bass 1983-1984), Boris Williams (drums 1984-1994), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards 1987 -1990, 1995-2005, 2011-present), Perry Bamonte (guitar, keyboards 1990-2005), Jason Cooper drums 1995-present) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar 2012-present)\n\nJust as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' \"L'Etranger\" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie & the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nFollowing this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the \"Second-class Joy Division\" tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let's Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985's The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band's punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo & The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots.\n\nTwo years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can't I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band's ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no.5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure's directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets.\n\nFollowing this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I'm In Love (no.6 in the UK and no.18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit.\n\nIn 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World  - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. \n\nIn May 2005, Smith fired Roger O'Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte's brother Daryl, who had been The Cure's tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure.\n\nIn early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album.\n\nThe band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called \"Hypnagogic States\" were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album's release.\n\n In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California.\n\nDuring 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film \"Alice in Wonderland\" and provided guest vocals on the songs \"Not in Love\" by Crystal Castles and \"Come to Me\" by 65daysofstatic.\n\nBetween 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O'Donnell performed with the band for the \"Seventeen Seconds\" and \"Faith\" concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the \"Faith\" concert. As of 2011, O'Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. \n\nIn 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japan, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.\n\nThe Cure official website: www.thecure.com\nThe Cure official Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/thecure\nThe Cure on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/thecure?ref=ts\nThe Cure - Disintegration Microsite: http://www.thecuredisintegration.com/bin/thecure <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\nShawn Mendes (born Shawn Peter Raul Mendes; August 8, 1998 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. After posting a series of his cover versions to various video-sharing sites, Mendes earned a dedicated following of viewers. His mix of Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's styles also appealed to Island Records, who signed Mendes in 2014. That same year they released the then-15-year-old's debut single, \"Life of the Party.\" American radio initially ignored it, but the track entered the Billboard 100 singles chart at number 24, making Mendes the youngest artist to land a debut single in the Top 25. The song was also included on Mendes' four-track Island debut, The Shawn Mendes EP. The EP performed well, reaching number five on the Billboard charts on its way toward sales of over 100,000, setting the stage for his full-length debut, 2015's Handwritten.\n\nPreceded by the single \"Something Big,\" Handwritten appeared to strong sales, debuting at number one in both Canada and the U.S. The single \"Stitches,\" which was released that April, became one of Mendes' biggest hits, reaching the Top Ten in the U.S. and Canada and topping the charts in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, his single \"Believe\" landed on the soundtrack for the Disney Channel fantasy musical Descendants. While opening for Taylor Swift on the North American dates of her 1989 World Tour, Mendes and Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello collaborated on the song \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" which appeared on the deluxe version of Handwritten that was released in November 2015; the song reached the Top 20 on the U.S. and Canadian Hot 100 charts.\n\nThe Top Ten single \"Treat You Better\" preceded Mendes' second album, Illuminate, which was recorded in upstate New York and arrived in September 2016. Illuminate, which featured co-songwriting contributions from Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris, debuted at number one in the U.S. and Canada, where it also achieved platinum status. It was quickly followed in December by the digital-only Live at Madison Square Garden. Mendes launched a massive world tour in the spring of 2017 and notched another Top Ten single in \"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back.\" Around this time, he also delivered a live acoustic session for MTV Unplugged.\n\nIn April of 2018, Shawn performed the single \"In My Blood\" at a concert for Queen Elizabeth II's 92nd birthday at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The track lyrically explored Mendes' struggles with anxiety disorder and was later released as the lead single for his eponymous third full-length which arrived in May of that year. The album, Shawn Mendes, which also featured collaborations with Teddy Geiger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/keyboardist Joe Hahn, and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band.\n\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005, and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in their first two albums, the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.\n\nLinkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), is a more electronic and pop-oriented record.\n\nLinkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists overall, having sold more than 70 million albums worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as \"The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.\n\nLinkin Park went into an indefinite hiatus after longtime lead vocalist Bennington died from suicide on July 20, 2017. \n\nLinkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero. Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.\n\nAfter spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'.\n\nThe band's renaissance culminated with another change in name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. The band initially wanted to use the name \"Lincoln Park\", however they changed it to \"Linkin\" to acquire the internet domain \"linkinpark.com\". The band still struggled to sign a record deal. Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, who had negotiated his employment contract with Warner Brothers to include signing Linkin Park, and was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. Farrell returned the following year and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory.\n\nLinkin Park has sold more than 100 million records. The group's first studio album Hybrid Theory is one of the best-selling albums in the US (11 million copies shipped) and worldwide (30 million copies sold). Billboard estimates that Linkin Park earned US$5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, making them the 40th-highest-paid musical artist. 11 of the band's singles have reached the number one position on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for any artist.\n\nIn 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. The band was recently voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!. In 2015, Kerrang! gave \"In the End\" and \"Final Masquerade\" the top two positions on Kerrang!'s Rock 100 list.\n\nLinkin Park became the first rock band to achieve more than one billion YouTube hits. Linkin Park also became the fifteenth most liked page on Facebook, tenth most liked artist, and most liked group followed by the Black Eyed Peas. Linkin Park's \"Numb\" is the third and \"In the End\" is the sixth \"timeless song\" on Spotify. The two songs make Linkin Park the only artist to have two timeless songs in top ten.\n\nHybrid Theory by the group is listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, It was also ranked at #11 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums of the Decade. In addition the album was included in Best of 2001 by Record Collector, The top 150 Albums of the Generation by Rock Sound and 50 Best Rock Albums of the 2000's by Kerrang!. The album Meteora was included in Top 200 Albums of the Decade by Billboard at #36. The album sold 20 million copies worldwide. The collaborated EP Collision Course with Jay-Z, became the second ever EP to top the Billboard 200, going on to sell over 300,000 copies in its first week after Alice in Chains' Jar of Flies in 1994. The album Minutes to Midnight in the United States, the album had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time, with 625,000 albums sold. In Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart. Worldwide, the album shipped over 3.3 million copies in its first four weeks of release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With the line-up comprising of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as one of the most influential bands of all time. The group was integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and socio-cultural movements. \n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are second best-selling music act of all time being surpassed by Rihanna, with certified sales of over 183 million units in the US and estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard's list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\nFormer Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original \"... In the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of African-American rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\".\n\nThey not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\n\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThere are two holidays celebrated for the Beatles: Global Beatles Day on 25 June each year. On that date in 1967, the band performed \"All You Need Is Love\" on television. In 2001, UNESCO created World Beatles Day on 16 January each year. This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.\n\nFive asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "David Guetta (born November 7th, 1967 in Paris) is a French DJ.\n\nHe was the pioneer of French house with \"Up & Away,\" a garage-style track with vocals by Robert Owens released in 1994 – really made a name for himself in the mid-90s as one of the key catalysts of Parisian nightlife by promoting evenings at such renowned Paris hot spots as Folies Pigalle, Queen, Bataclan, Palace and Les Bains, where he invited DJ legends like Little Louie Vega, David Morales, DJ Pierre and Roger Sanchez to join him on the turntables. In 2001, however, he went back to his first love: making music.\n\nLaunched by the single \"Just A Little More Love,\" an electro-funk-house cocktail featuring Chris Willis of the band Nashville on vocals, David Guetta’s first album was released by Virgin in June 2002 and went on to sell 250,000 copies. This resounding success carried through in the album's second, even more devastating single, \"Love Don't Let Me Go,\" a track reminiscent of Moroder's techno-disco style crossed with Depeche Mode's new-wave sound.\n\nLike fellow Frenchman Laurent Garnier, David started off his career in the gay clubs around Paris. Les Halles district in the mid-80s, going on to make a name for himself in acid-house and hip-hop. His first album heralded the beginning of a new DJ career – this time on a global level. Named after the parties he hosts on Ibiza, the fabled isle of techno, David's \"F*** ME I'M FAMOUS: IBIZA DJ MIX\", which featured his remix of David Bowie's \"Heroes,\" went gold: no small feat for a compilation CD. For the last three years, David has been invited to mix throughout Europe on a regular basis and, more and more often, in the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Israel as well. He is also resident DJ at The Cross in London, Barcelona ‘s Discoteca and the Lausanne club Mad.\n\nPropelled by the rock guitars of the single Money, David’s second album, GUETTA BLASTER, is even gutsier. David and Joachim Garraud (the first album’s co-composer and co-producer) applied themselves to creating real songs modeled on electro-pop classics of the 80s by such masters as Depeche Mode, Yazoo, Dead Or Alive, and New Order, to name the most prominent influences. All the tracks on this second album are original compositions. The gospel sounds of Chris Willis and the stylings of guest vocalists JD Davis (lead singer of Sinema), James Perry (alias Jimmy Polo, renowned singer/producer on the Chicago scene) and Britain’s Stereo MCs give the tracks a unique luster, while the production skills of Guetta and Garraud lift the album to new – and always spectacular – heights.\n\nFrom GUETTA BLASTER’s opening salvos, \"Money and Stay,\" we get beats that are cranked up a notch beyond the hard-dance formula of \"Just A Little More Love.\" Without an ounce of hesitation, the album launches itself at the experimental roots of house music and cold-wave, displaying an unexpected stylistic versatility, then oscillates between powerful mixtures of hot & cold and black & white. The result is 100% addictive.\n\n\"Used To Be The One,\" with vocals by Willis, owes a debt to both Yazoo’s Don't Go and garage music. Similarly, the counterpoint of Time evokes Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams, blending the best of English pop and dance culture – something David has mastered like no one else. Open Your Eyes, a track tailor-made for the Stereo MCs, is built on a rubbery break beat and an acid sequence, with a rap that brings their classic Connected to mind. The abrasive AC/DC, clearly a future hit on the underground/rave circuit, is like the missing link between Jeff Mills and Ministry of Sound.\n\nTwo velvet-smooth cuts neatly crown the album: \"In Love With Myself,\" a track that could hold its own against Moroder & Oakey’s Electric Dreams any day, is followed by \"Higher,\" on which Chris Willis pays homage to the style of phrasing and embellishment popularized by Stevie Wonder, an approach that has proliferated in both R&B and garage/house music à la New Jersey duo Blaze. GUETTA BLASTER drives its point home with the metronomic Movement Girl, featuring James Perry, and the killer Get Up, on which macho riffs, the hysterical falsetto of Chris Willis and screaming guitars swirl around a punchy beat.\nOn GUETTA BLASTER, David Guetta has not only successfully avoided the pitfalls of second albums – he has truly launched himself into a new dimension.\nThe song \"Just A Little More Love\" appeared in the film The Football Factory, was sung in the Gospel version at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\nOn New Year's Day 2007 he appeared at Big Beach Boutique 3, a concert held on the beach of Brighton, UK, put together by and headlined by Fatboy Slim.\nHis fourth album is \"Pop Life\" released in France on 23 April, 2007 with the leading single\n\"Love is gone.\"\n\n24.

        "content": "ABBA is a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in  1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest. They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition.\n\nInteresting facts:\nABBA is the first group from Sweden to sell five million tickets to the Wembley arena in less than a week. They are the first super pop group to receive a $ 1 billion contract before the breakup to stage another concert tour and record another album. They are the first group to open to many musicians from Sweden, the gates of the Western music industry. Many musicians said that ABBA was their inspiration, encouragement, and the most influential group that encouraged them to start their music career. With its discography, ABBA has shown and made Sweden the most powerful music industry of the 20th century with only the United Kingdom has been able to achieve the same feat. They are the first group and the richest members to buy 85% of the Swedish industry from the gross profits from the sale of their albums.\n\nDuring the band's active years, it was composed of two married couples: Fältskog and Ulvaeus, and Lyngstad and Andersson. With the increase of their popularity, their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages. The relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions featuring darker and more introspective lyrics. After ABBA disbanded in January 1983, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success in writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success. ABBA's music declined in popularity until the purchase of ABBA's catalog and record company Polar by Polygram in 1989 enabled the groundwork to be laid for an international re-issue of all their original material and a new Greatest Hits (ABBA Gold) collection in September 1992, which became a worldwide bestseller. Several films, notably Muriel's Wedding (1994) and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), further revived interest in the group and spawned several tribute bands. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. A sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was released in 2018. On 27 April 2018, it was announced that the band had recorded two new songs after 35 years of being inactive, named \"I Still Have Faith in You\" and \"Don’t Shut Me Down\". On 18 September 2018, in an interview, Andersson said that they are still working on the songs, with possibly a third one written.\n\nEstimates of ABBA's total record sales are over 380 - 550 million, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. ABBA is the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. Their success has opened the door for many other European groups. Their enduring legacy marks the Swedish music industry as a mainstream player. They have a joint record of eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. ABBA was honored at the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005 when their hit \"Waterloo\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2015, their song \"Dancing Queen\" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame.\n \nHistory – 1958–1970: Before ABBA. Member origins and collaboration:\nBenny Andersson (born 16 December 1946 in Stockholm, Sweden) became (at age 18) a member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, the Hep Stars, which performed covers, amongst other things, of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as \"the Swedish Beatles\". They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of Apple Corps. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including \"No Response\" that hit number-three in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number-one in 1966. Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with Lasse Berghagen, with whom he wrote his first Svensktoppen entry, \"Sagan om Lilla Sofie\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\"), in 1968.\n\nBjörn Ulvaeus (born 25 April 1945 in Gothenburg, Sweden) also began his musical career at the age of 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted the Hootenanny Singers, a popular Swedish folk–skiffle group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by The Hep Stars. Stig Anderson was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the Polar Music label. He saw potential in the collaboration and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"Ljuva sextital\" (\"Sweet Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\n \nAndersson wrote and submitted the song \"Hej, Clown\" for Melodifestivalen 1969, the national festival to select the Swedish entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place. On that occasion, Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called Lycka (\"Happiness\"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their partners were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fältskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with The Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records. Agnetha Fältskog (born 5 April 1950 in Jönköping, Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. \n\nThe demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: \"Jag var så kär\" (\"I Was So in Love\"). Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. The critics and songwriters soon noticed her as a talented singer/songwriter of schlager style songs. Fältskog's main inspirations in her early years were singers such as Connie Francis. Along with her compositions, she recorded covers of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish folk parks. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.\n\nDuring the filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fältskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. Fältskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions, and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to Fältskog's third studio album, Som jag är (\"As I Am\") (1970). In 1972, Fältskog starred as Mary Magdalene in the original Swedish production of Jesus Christ Superstar and attracted favorable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, Fältskog released five studio albums.\n \nAnni-Frid \"Frida\" Lyngstad (born 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen in Ballangen, Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with \"En ledig dag\" (\"A Day Off\") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song \"A Day in Portofino\", which is included in the EMI compilation Frida 1967–1972. The first prize was a recording contract with EMI Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 31/2-hour documentary Frida – The DVD. Lyngstad released several schlager style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, \"Min egen stad\" (\"My Town\"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folk park circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest and Fältskog during a TV show in early 1968.\n \nLyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later, they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single \"Peter Pan\" in September 1969—her first collaboration with Benny & Björn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, Frida, which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, Frida ensam, which included a Swedish rendition of \"Fernando\", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.\n \nAn attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, Lycka, which was to be released in September 1970. Fältskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, \"Festfolket\" (which translates from Swedish to mean both \"Party People\" and \"Engaged Couples\"), on 1 November 1970 in Gothenburg.\n \nThe cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit \"Hej, gamle man\" (\"Hello, Old Man\")–the first Björn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.\nFirst record together \"Hej, gamle man.\" \"Hej, gamle man\", a song about an old Salvation Army soldier, became the quartet's first hit. The record was credited to Björn & Benny and reached number five on the sales charts and number one on Svensktoppen, staying there for 15 weeks. It was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others' recordings. Fältskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer.\n \n1970–1973: Forming the group:\nAfter the 1970 release of Lycka, two more singles credited to \"Björn & Benny\" were released in Sweden, \"Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa\" (\"No Doctor Can Help with That\") and \"Tänk om jorden vore ung\" (\"Imagine If Earth Was Young\"), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad–and moderate chart success.\nFältskog and Ulvaeus, now married, started performing together with Andersson regularly at the Swedish folkparks in the middle of 1971. Stig Anderson, founder and owner of Polar Music, was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. \"One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit,\" he predicted.\n \nStig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971, Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song \"Säg det med en sång\" (\"Say It with a Song\") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden. The first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" was released through Epic Records in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit. Two more singles were released in Japan, \"En Carousel\" (\"En Karusell\" in Scandinavia, an earlier version of \"Merry-Go-Round\") and \"Love Has Its Ways\" (a song they wrote with Kōichi Morita).\n \nFirst hit as Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid/Frida:\nUlvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. \"People Need Love\" was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence. Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid. The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something. The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the Cashbox singles chart and number 117 on the Record World singles chart. Labeled as Björn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka), it was released there through Playboy Records. However, according to Stig Anderson, \"People Need Love\" could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers.\n \n\"Ring Ring.\"\nIn 1973, the band and their manager Stig Anderson decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song \"Ring Ring\". Michael B. Tretow, who experimented with a “wall of sound” production technique that became the wholly new sound, handled the studio sessions. Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by Neil Sedaka and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner. However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus, it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called Ring Ring. The album did well and the \"Ring Ring\" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit. When Agnetha Fältskog gave birth to her daughter Linda in 1973, Inger Brundin replaced her for a short period on a trip to West Germany.\n \nOfficial naming:\nIn 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA (a palindrome). At first, this was a play on words, as Abba is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an abbreviation. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as \"ABBA\". The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name. Fred Bronson reported for Billboard that Fältskog told him in a 1988 interview \"[ABBA] had to ask permission and the factory said, 'O.K., as long as you don't make us feel ashamed for what you're doing'.\" \"ABBA\" is an acronym formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: Agnetha, Björn, Benny, and Anni-Frid. The earliest known example of \"ABBA\" written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in Stockholm dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as \"Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida\", but was subsequently crossed out with \"ABBA\" written in large letters on top.\n \nOfficial logo:\nTheir official logo, distinct with the backward ‘B', was designed by Rune Söderqvist, who designed most of ABBA's record sleeves. The logo first appeared on the French compilation album, Golden Double Album, released in May 1976 by Disques Vogue, and would henceforth be used for all official releases. The German photographer Wolfgang “Bubi” Heilemann (de) on a velvet jumpsuit photoshoot for the teenage magazine Bravo made the idea for the official logo. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter \"B\"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored \"B\", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onwards, the first \"B\" in the logo version of the name was \"mirror-image\" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's registered trademark.\n \nFollowing their acquisition of the group's catalog, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, employing a different font. In 1992, Polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation. After Universal Music purchased PolyGram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalog returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.\n \n1973–1976: Breakthrough Eurovision Song Contest 1974:\nAs the group entered the Melodifestivalen with \"Ring Ring\" but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest. Ulvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the Eurovision Song Contest as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters, as well as the band itself. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the Melodifestivalen 1974 and from several new songs, the upbeat song \"Waterloo\" was chosen; the growing glam rock scene in England now inspired the group.\n \nABBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest. Winning the 1974 Contest on 6 April 1974 (and singing Waterloo in English instead of their native tongue) gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the \"Waterloo\" single chart in many European countries. \"Waterloo\" was ABBA's first number-one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there. Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American television, The Mike Douglas Show. The album Waterloo only peaked at number 145 on the Billboard 200 chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: Los Angeles Times called it \"a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively ... an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project\", while Creem characterized it as \"a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions.\"\n \nABBA's follow-up single, \"Honey, Honey\", peaked at number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was a number-two hit in West Germany. However, in the United Kingdom, ABBA's British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of \"Ring Ring\" instead of \"Honey, Honey\", and a cover version of the latter by Sweet Dreams peaked at number 10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. \"Ring Ring\" failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision one-hit-wonder.\n\nPost-Eurovision:\nIn November 1974, ABBA embarked on its first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany, and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued in the middle of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their Stockholm show at the Gröna Lund amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200. Björn Ulvaeus later said, \"If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo, we were trying to be more like the Sweet, a semi-glam rock group, which was stupid because we were always a pop group.\"\n \nIn late 1974, \"So Long\" was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart. In the middle of 1975, ABBA released \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\", which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to number 38. Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album ABBA and single \"SOS\" brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13. \"SOS\" also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia. Success was further solidified with \"Mamma Mia\" reaching number one in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. In the United States, \"SOS\" peaked at number 10 on the Record World Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, picking up the BMI Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975. The success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous ABBA album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the Cashbox album chart and number 174 on the Billboard 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by Creem in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured \"a very sloppy promotional campaign\". Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press. Cashbox went as far as saying that \"there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity, and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts\", while Creem wrote: \"SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles.\"\n \nIn Australia, the airing of the music videos for \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\" and \"Mamma Mia\" on the nationally broadcast TV pop show Countdown (which premiered in November 1974) saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity, and Countdown become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos. This started an immense interest in ABBA in Australia, resulting in both the single and album holding down the No. 1 positions on the charts for months.\n \n1976–1981: Superstardom:\nIn March 1976, the band released the compilation album Greatest Hits. It became their first UK number-one album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there. Also included on Greatest Hits was a new single, \"Fernando\", which went to number-one in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia, and the single went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. In Australia, the song occupied the top position for 14 weeks (and stayed in the chart for 40 weeks), tying with the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" for longest-running number-one, and making \"Fernando\" one of the best-selling singles of all time. That same year, the group received its first international prize, with \"Fernando\" being chosen as the \"Best Studio Recording of 1975\". In the United States, \"Fernando\" reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named The Very Best of ABBA, also becoming a number-one album there whereas the Greatest Hits compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with The Very Best album.\n \nThe group's fourth studio album, Arrival, a number-one best-seller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as Melody Maker and New Musical Express, and mostly appreciative notices from US critics. Hit after hit flowed from Arrival: \"Money, Money, Money\", another number-one in Germany and Australia, and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\", ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one. The real sensation was \"Dancing Queen\", not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany, and Australia but also reaching number-one in the United States. In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with \"Fernando\", \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976–77. In 1977, Arrival was nominated for the inaugural BRIT Award in the category \"Best International Album of the Year\". By this time, ABBA was popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In Frida – The DVD, Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.\n \nThe band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and \"Dancing Queen\" became the only Billboard Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other Billboard charts, including Billboard Adult Contemporary and Hot Dance Club Play). Nevertheless, Arrival finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by RIAA.\n \nEuropean and Australian tour:\nIn January 1977, ABBA embarked on its first major tour. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were regarded as superstars. They opened their much-anticipated tour in Oslo, Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta The Girl with the Golden Hair. The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Berlin, Cologne, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Essen, Hanover, and Hamburg and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5 million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise (\"ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records\", wrote Creem), there were complaints that \"ABBA performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage\" (Melody Maker). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ABBA: The Movie, though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.\n \nAfter the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the Sydney Showground on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in Melbourne, a civic reception was held at the Melbourne Town Hall and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000. In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl with 14,500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In Adelaide, the group performed one concert at West Lakes Football Stadium in front of 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside.\n \nDuring the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the Entertainment Centre. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (\"Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia\", wrote Variety), and is captured on film in ABBA: The Movie, directed by Lasse Hallström. The Australian tour and its subsequent ABBA: The Movie produced some ABBA lore, as well. Fältskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's \"pin-up girl\", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline \"Agnetha's bottom tops dull show\". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: \"Don't they have bottoms in Australia?\"\n \nIn December 1977, ABBA followed up Arrival with the more ambitious fifth album ABBA: The Album, released to coincide with the debut of ABBA: The Movie. Although the album was less well-received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: \"The Name of the Game\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number three, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. Although \"Take a Chance on Me\" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than \"Dancing Queen\". The album also included \"Thank You for the Music\", the B-side of \"Eagle\" in countries where the latter had been released as a single and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983. \"Thank You for the Music\" has become one of the best-loved and best-known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime.\n \nPolar Music Studio formation:\nBy 1978 ABBA was one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant cinema into the Polar Music Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in Stockholm. Several other bands used the studio; notably, Genesis' Duke and Led Zeppelin's in through the out Door were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside Andy Gibb on Olivia Newton-John's TV show. Recording sessions for the single \"Summer Night City\" were an uphill struggle,[citation needed] but upon release, the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into disco with their next album. On 9 January 1979, the group performed \"Chiquitita\" at the Music for UNICEF Concert held at the United Nations General Assembly to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child. ABBA donated the copyright of this worldwide hit to the UNICEF; see Music for UNICEF Concert. The single was released the following week and reached number-one in ten countries.\n\nNorth American and European tours: \nIn mid-January 1979, Ulvaeus and Fältskog announced they were getting divorced. The news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band's future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them. Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly traveled to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs. The group's sixth studio album, Voulez-Vous, was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with the assistance of recording engineer Tom Dowd amongst others. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States. None of the singles from the album reached number-one on the UK charts, but \"Chiquitita\", \"Does Your Mother Know\", \"Angeleyes\" (with \"Voulez-Vous\", released as a double A-side) and \"I Have a Dream\" were all UK Top 5 hits. In Canada, \"I Have a Dream\" became ABBA's second number-one on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart (after \"Fernando\" hit the top previously).\n \nAlso in 1979, the group released their second compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol. 2, which featured a brand new track: \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", another number-three hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group was paid in oil commodities because of an embargo on the ruble. On 13 September 1979, ABBA began ABBA: The Tour at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. \"The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning\", raved Edmonton Journal. During the next four weeks, they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in Washington, D.C. was canceled due to Fältskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston when the group's private plane was subjected to extreme weather conditions and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared at the Boston Music Hall for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at Maple Leaf Gardens before a capacity crowd of 18,000. \"ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied\", wrote Record World. On 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's Wembley Arena.\n \nProgression:\nSuper Trouper, seventh studio album released by the group in 1980.\nIn March 1980, ABBA traveled to Japan where upon their arrival at Narita International Airport, they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's Budokan. This tour was the last \"on the road\" adventure of their career. In the middle of 1980, the group released the single \"The Winner Takes It All\" the group's eighth UK chart-topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and Fältskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics but has stated they were not about his divorce; Fältskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse Mireille Mathieu at the end of 1980 – as \"Bravo tu as gagné\", with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. \n\nNovember the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album Super Trouper, which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. The second single from the album, \"Super Trouper\", also hit number one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the Super Trouper album, \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", released in 1981 as a 12-inch (300 mm) single only in selected territories, managed to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting 12-inch (300 mm) release in UK chart history. Also in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called Gracias Por La Música. This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of \"Chiquitita\", this signaled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos, the Spanish equivalent of ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits, was released in 1999.\n\n1981–1982: Final album and performances:\nIn January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena Källersjö, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track \"Hovas Vittone\" (a pun on the Swedish name for Jehovah's Witness and Anderson's birthplace, Hova) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that her marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nörklit, whom he married in November 1981. Andersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions in early 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, Dick Cavett Meets ABBA with the US talk show host Dick Cavett. The Visitors, ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, aging, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, \"One of Us\", proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. \"One of Us\" was also ABBA's final Top 3 hit in the UK, reaching No. 1 on some charts (such as Record Mirror).\n \nAlthough it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including Ireland, the UK, and Germany, The Visitors was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia, and Japan. A track from the album, \"When All Is Said and Done\", was released as a single in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"One of Us\", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicized story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of The Visitors, which hit the Top Ten on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n \nFinal recording sessions:\nIn the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: \"You Owe Me One\", \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer. Back in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double-album compilation of all their past single releases to be named The Singles: The First Ten Years. New songwriting and recording sessions took place, and during October and December, they released the singles \"The Day Before You Came\"/\"Cassandra\" and \"Under Attack\"/\"You Owe Me One\", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though \"The Day Before You Came\" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The album went to number one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. \"Under Attack\", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium. \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\" were left unreleased on The Singles: The First Ten Years for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. \"I Am the City\" was eventually released on the compilation album More ABBA Gold in 1993, while \"Just Like That\" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus.\n \nA reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical Chess. The chorus section of \"Just Like That\" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ABBA Undeleted medley featured on disc 9 of The Complete Studio Recordings. Despite several requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of \"Just Like That\" in its entirety, even though the complete version has surfaced on bootlegs. The group traveled to London to promote The Singles: The First Ten Years in the first week of November 1982, appearing on Saturday Superstore and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV program Nöjesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on Noel Edmonds' The Late, Late Breakfast Show, through a live link from a TV studio in Stockholm.\n \nFinal performances:\nAndersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with Tim Rice in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project Chess, while Fältskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical Abbacadabra that was produced in France for television. It was children’s musical utilizing 14 ABBA songs. Alain and Daniel Boublil, who wrote Les Misérables, had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of \"The Winner Takes It All\".\n \nAnni-Frid Lyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version and recorded a single, \"Belle\", a duet with French singer Daniel Balavoine. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\". As the single \"Belle\" sold well in France, Cameron Mackintosh wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by David Wood and Don Black; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, \"I Am the Seeker\". \"Abbacadabra\" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording \"Belle\" in English as \"Time\", a duet with actor and singer B. A. Robertson: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt. A year later, Lyngstad performed \"I Have A Dream\" with a children's choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala, in May 1984 at Geneva, Switzerland. All four members made their (at the time, their final) public appearance as four friends more than as ABBA in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of \"Tivedshambo\" (which was the first song written by their manager Stig Anderson), for a Swedish TV show honoring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, Claes af Geijerstam. They sang a self-written song titled \"Der Kleine Franz\" that was later to resurface in Chess. Also in 1986, ABBA Live was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of Görel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also a former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honoring Görel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song \"Med En Enkel Tulipan\" a cappella.\n \nBenny Andersson has on several occasions performed old ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with U2 at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of \"Dancing Queen\", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his BAO band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" with opera singer Anne Sofie von Otter, and \"When All Is Said and Done\" with Swede Viktoria Tolstoy. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed a cappella rendition of the first verse of \"Fernando\" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of \"Dancing Queen\" with the Swedish group the Real Group in 1993 and also re-recorded \"I Have a Dream\" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.\n\nIn the summer of 1982, the band gathered to record a new album. In the end, they just released a double album - a compilation of all their previous successes with two new songs. The double album The Singles: The First Ten Years took first place on the UK charts and sold great worldwide. The new songs were Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which was the last song ABBA recorded together. Two more songs were recorded during 1982: I Am The City and Just Like That. Although both are completed, only I Am The City was released on a 1993 compilation, despite numerous attempts by fans. Bjorn and Benny still refuse to publish Just Like That. The group gradually broke up as its members began to do various projects. Benny and Bjorn collaborated with Tim Rice to write the musical Shah, while Agneta and Frida worked on their solo albums.\n\nDissolution:\nABBA has never officially announced the end of the group, but it has long been considered dissolved. Their final public performance together as ABBA was on the British TV program The Late, Late Breakfast Show (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982. While reminiscing on \"The Day Before You Came\", Ulvaeus said: \"we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one.\" In January 1983, Fältskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album Something's Going On some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical Chess. In interviews at the time, Björn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (\"Who are we without our ladies? Initials of Brigitte Bardot?\"), and Lyngstad and Fältskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in Polar Music during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the Mamma Mia! Movie on 4 July 2008.\n \nIn an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: \"We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember Robert Plant saying Led Zeppelin were a cover band now because they cover all their stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head.\" However, on 3 January 2011, Fältskog, long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members. In April 2013, she reiterated her hopes for a reunion during an interview with Die Zeit, stating, \"If they ask me, I'll say yes.\" In a May 2013 interview, Fältskog, aged 63 at the time, stated that an ABBA reunion would never occur: \"I think we have to accept that it will not happen because we are too old and each one of us has their own life. Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there's no meaning in putting us together again.\" Fältskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms: \"It's always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic.\" In an April 2014 interview, Fältskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: \"It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: \"ABBA is going to record another song!\" But as long as we can sing and play, then why not? I would love to, but it's up to Björn and Benny.\"\n \nThe resurgence of public interest:\nThe same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a \"tribute\" show (a children's TV musical named Abbacadabra using 14 ABBA songs) spawned a new interest in the group's music. After receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo Erasure, who released Abba-Esque, a four-track extended play release featuring cover versions of ABBA songs which topped several European charts in 1992. As U2 arrived in Stockholm for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of \"Dancing Queen\", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits, a new compilation album. The single \"Dancing Queen\" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16. With sales of 30 million, Gold is the best-selling ABBA album, as well as one of the best-selling albums worldwide. With sales of 5.5 million copies, it is the second-highest selling album of all time in the UK, after Queen's Greatest Hits. The enormous interest in the ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation saw the release of More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits in 1993.\n \nIn 1994, two Australian cult films caught the attention of the world's media, both focusing on admiration for ABBA: The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Muriel's Wedding. The same year, Thank You for the Music, a four-disc box set comprising the entire group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. \"By the end of the twentieth century,\" American critic Chuck Klosterman wrote a decade later, \"it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them.\"ABBA was soon recognized and embraced by other acts: Evan Dando of the Lemonheads recorded a cover version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\"; Sinéad O'Connor and Boyzone's Stephen Gately have recorded \"Chiquitita\"; Tanita Tikaram, Blancmange, and Steven Wilson paid tribute to \"The Day Before You Came\". Cliff Richard covered \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", while Dionne Warwick, Peter Cetera, and Celebrity Skin recorded their versions of \"SOS\". US alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" in concert appearances, while legendary English Latin pop songwriter Richard Daniel Roman has recognized ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen covered \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" with slightly altered lyrics.\n\nTwo different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. ABBA: A Tribute coincided with the 25th-anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's \"One of Us\", Army of Lovers \"Hasta Mañana\", Information Society's \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", Erasure's \"Take a Chance on Me\" (with MC Kinky), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of \"Dancing Queen\". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled ABBAmania, with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all-new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness (\"Money, Money, Money\"), Culture Club (\"Voulez-Vous\"), the Corrs (\"The Winner Takes It All\"), Steps (\"Lay All Your Love on Me\", \"I Know Him So Well\"), and a medley entitled \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.\n\nIn 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the A-Teens to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, \"The ABBA Generation\", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as the 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a grueling schedule and intentions to go solo. In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 B & B Concerts, a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts. In 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion US dollars to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts. For the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members made cameo appearances in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video Ever\". Other well-known stars such as Rik Mayall, Cher, and Iron Maiden's Eddie also made appearances in the video. It was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest but was issued as a separate DVD release, re-titled The Last Video at the request of the former ABBA members.\n\nIn 2005, all four members of ABBA appeared at the Stockholm premiere of the musical Mamma Mia!.[63] On 22 October 2005, at the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest, \"Waterloo\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history. On 4 July 2008, all four ABBA members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the film Mamma Mia!. It was only the second time all of them had appeared together in public since 1986. During the appearance, they re-emphasized that they intended never to officially reunite, citing the opinion of Robert Plant that the re-formed Led Zeppelin was more like a cover band of itself than the original band. Ulvaeus stated that he wanted the band to be remembered as they were during the peak years of their success.\n \nPosing together with the actors from the motion picture Mamma Mia! The Movie on 4 July 2008, is the original ABBA members. Far left, Benny Andersson. Fifth from left, Agnetha Fältskog, with her hand on Anni-Frid Lyngstad's shoulder. Second from right, Björn Ulvaeus. The compilation album ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits, originally released in 1992, returned to number one in the UK album charts for the fifth time on 3 August 2008. On 14 August 2008, the Mamma Mia! The Movie film soundtrack went to number-one on the US Billboard charts, ABBA's first US chart-topping album. During the band's heyday, the highest album chart position they had ever achieved in America was number 14. In November 2008, all eight studio albums, together with a ninth of rare tracks, was released as The Albums. It hit several charts, peaking at number four in Sweden and reaching the Top 10 in several other European territories.\n\nIn 2008, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, in collaboration with Universal Music Group Sweden AB, released SingStar ABBA on both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 games consoles, as part of the SingStar music video games. The PS2 version features 20 ABBA songs, while 25 songs feature on the PS3 version.\nOn 22 January 2009, Fältskog and Lyngstad appeared together on stage to receive the Swedish music award \"Rockbjörnen\" (for \"lifetime achievement\"). In an interview, the two women expressed their gratitude for the honorary award and thanked their fans. On 25 November 2009, PRS for Music announced that the British public voted ABBA as the band they would most like to see re-form. On 27 January 2010, ABBA WORLD, a 25-room touring exhibition featuring interactive and audiovisual activities, debuted at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London. According to the exhibition's website, ABBA WORLD is \"approved and fully supported\" by the band members. \"Mamma Mia\" was released as one of the first few non-premium song selections for the online RPG game Bandmaster. On 17 May 2011, \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\" was added as a non-premium song selection for the Bandmaster Philippines server. \n\nOn 15 November 2011, Ubisoft released a dancing game called ABBA: You Can Dance for the Wii. In January 2012, Universal Music announced the re-release of ABBA's final album The Visitors, featuring a previously unheard track \"From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel\". A book entitled ABBA: The Official Photo Book was published in early 2014 to mark the 40th anniversary of the band's Eurovision victory. The book reveals that part of the reason for the band's outrageous costumes was that Swedish tax laws at the time allowed the cost of garish outfits that were not suitable for daily wear to be tax-deductible. A sequel to the 2008 movie Mamma Mia!, titled Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was announced on 20 May 2017 and then the film was released on 20 July 2018. Cher, who appeared in the movie, also released Dancing Queen, an album full of ABBA covers, in September 2018. In June 2017, a blue plaque outside Brighton Dome was set to commemorate their 1974 Eurovision win. 2016–present: Reunion and upcoming avatars project. On 20 January 2016, all four original members of ABBA made a public appearance at Mamma Mia! The Party in Stockholm. On 6 June 2016, the four members of ABBA appeared together at a private party at Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Andersson and Ulvaeus's first meeting. Fältskog and Lyngstad sang the ABBA song \"The Way Old Friends Do\" before Andersson and Ulvaeus joined them on stage.\n\nBritish manager Simon Fuller announced in a statement in October 2016 that the group would be reuniting to work on a new 'digital entertainment experience'. The project would feature the members in their \"life-like\" avatar form ('abbatars') based on their late 1970s tour and would be set to launch by the spring of 2019. On 27 April 2018, the members announced that they had recorded two new songs, one entitled \"I Still Have Faith in You\", to feature in a TV special set to air later that year. The other new track is called \"Don't Shut Me Down\".\nIn September 2018, Björn Ulvaeus revealed that the two new songs, \"I Still Have Faith in You\" and \"Don't Shut Me Down\", as well as the aforementioned TV special now called ABBA: Thank You for the Music, An All-Star Tribute, would be released no earlier than March 2019. In January 2019, Björn Ulvaeus revealed that neither song was finished yet, hinting at a final mix date of spring 2019 and the possibility of a third song.\nIn June 2019, Björn announced that the first new song and video containing the Abbatars would be released in November 2019. In September 2019, Björn stated in an interview that there were now five new ABBA songs to be released in 2020.\n\nIn April 2020, Ulvaeus gave an interview saying that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the avatar project had been delayed by six months. As of 2020, five out of the eight original songs written by Benny for the new album had been recorded by the two female members, and the release of a new music video with new unseen technology that cost £15 million was to be decided. In July 2020, Ulvaeus told podcaster Geoff Lloyd that the release of the new ABBA recordings had been delayed until 2021.\n\nOn 22 September 2020, all four ABBA members reunited at Ealing Studios in London to continue working on the avatar project and filming for the tour. Björn said that the avatar tour would be scheduled for 2022 since the nature of the technology was complex. When questioned if the new recordings were definitely coming out in 2021, Björn said \"There will be new music this year, that is definite, it's not a case anymore of it might happen, it will happen.\"\n\nABBA Voyage\nOn 26 August 2021, a new website was launched, with the title ABBA Voyage. On the page, visitors were prompted to subscribe \"to be the first in line to hear more about ABBA Voyage\". Simultaneously with the launch of the webpage, new ABBA Voyage social media accounts were launched, and billboards around London started to appear, all showing the date \"02.09.21\", leading to expectation of what was to be revealed on that date. On 29 August, the band officially joined TikTok with a video of Benny Andersson playing \"Dancing Queen\" on the piano, and media reported on a new album to be announced on 2 September. On that date, Voyage, their first new album in 40 years, was announced to be released on 5 November 2021, along with ABBA Voyage, a concert residency in London featuring the motion capture digital avatars of the four band members alongside a 10-piece live band, due to start in May 2022. Fältskog stated that the Voyage album and tour are likely to be their last.\n\nThe announcement of the new album was accompanied by the release of the previously-announced new singles \"I Still Have Faith in You\" and \"Don't Shut Me Down\".  The music video for \"I Still Have Faith in You\", featuring footage of the band during their performing years and also a first look at the ABBAtars, earned over a million views in its first three hours.  \"Don't Shut Me Down\" became the first ABBA release since October 1978 to top the singles chart in Sweden.  In October 2021, the third single \"Just a Notion\" was released, and it was announced that ABBA would split for good after the release of 'Voyage'.  However, in an interview with BBC Radio 2 on 11 November, Lyngstad stated \"don't be too sure\" that Voyage is the final ABBA album.  Also, in an interview with BBC News on 5 November, Andersson stated \"if they (the ladies) twist my arm I might change my mind.\" The fourth single from the album, “Little Things”, was released on 3 December\n\nSolo careers - Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus:\nIn October 1984, Ulvaeus and Andersson together with lyricist Tim Rice released the musical concept double-album Chess. The singles \"One Night in Bangkok\" (with vocals by Murray Head and Anders Glenmark ) and \"I Know Him So Well\" (a duet by Barbara Dickson and Elaine Paige, and later also recorded by both Barbra Streisand and Whitney Houston) were both hugely successful. The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France, and New Zealand; number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden, and the US, as well as reaching the top 10 in a few other countries. In May 1986, the musical premiered in London's West End and ran for almost three years. Chess also opened on Broadway in April 1988 but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged Chess på Svenska (Chess in Swedish) in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers \"Han är en man, Han är ett barn\" (\"He's a man, He's a Child\") and \"Glöm mig om du kan\" (\"Forget Me If You Can\"). In 2008, the musical was again revived for a successful staging at London's Royal Albert Hall which was subsequently released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the United States and the United Kingdom, in 2010.\n \nBenny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus' next project, Kristina från Duvemåla, an epic Swedish musical, premiered in Malmö, in southern Sweden in October 1995. The musical ran for five years in Stockholm, and an English version has been in development for some considerable time. It has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre-production. In the meantime, following some earlier workshops, a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert, now with the shortened name of \"Kristina\", took place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New York's Carnegie Hall, and in April 2010 at London's Royal Albert Hall, followed by a CD release of the New York recordings. Since 1983, besides Chess and Kristina från Duvemåla, Benny Andersson has continued writing songs with Ulvaeus. The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo Gemini in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his label, Mono Music, called \"Klinga mina klockor\" (\"Ring My Bells\"), all new material inspired by Swedish folk music – and followed it with his second album titled November 1989. During the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet Ainbusk Singers, giving them two hits: \"Lassie\" and \"Älska mig\" (\"Love me\"), and later produced Shapes, an English-language album by group's Josefin Nilsson with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor). In 2001, Andersson formed his band, Benny Anderssons Orkester (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio Svensktoppen charts; the song \"Du är min man\" (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by Helen Sjöholm, spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009. Andersson released his third album BAO 3 in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sjöholm and Tommy Körberg, as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.\n \nBjörn Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of the Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of Västervik, singing their 1966 hit \"Marianne\". Andersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical Mamma Mia!, alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilizing many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a \"fisherman\" piano player in the \"Dancing Queen\" scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing the lyre during the closing credits.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote seven songs for Anderssons BAO 2011 album 'O Klang Och Jubeltid', performed as usual by vocalists Sjöholm, Körberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO released their first international release, now named the Benny Andersson Band, with the album The Story of a Heart. The album was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's Ken Bruce Show. A Swedish-language version of the title track, \"Sommaren Du Fick\" (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden before the English version, with vocals by Helen Sjöholm. In May 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned Stockholm hotel Hotel Rival, titled \"2nd Best to None\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer Sissela Kyle, titled \"Jag vill bli gammal\" (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show \"Your Days Are Numbered\", which was never recorded and released, but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for Sarah Brightman's cover version recorded for her 2008 album Winter Symphony. \n\nNew English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song \"Innan Gryningen\" (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for Barbara Dickson (performed live, but not yet recorded and released). In 2007, they wrote the new song \"Han som har vunnit allt\" (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor/singer Anders Ekborg. Björn wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Benny's solo albums: \"I Walk with You Mama\" (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989) and \"After the Rain\" (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer Anne Sofie von Otter, for her Andersson tribute album I Let the Music Speak. Barbara Dickson recorded (but not yet released) a Björn & Benny song called \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the song eventually was released by Australian Mamma Mia! musical star Anne Wood 201 album of ABBA covers, Divine Discontent. As of October 2012, Björn Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Benny for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'), and Benny is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, \"Hjälp Sökes\" (\"Help Wanted\") together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013. Andersson has also written music for a documentary film about Olof Palme, re-recording the track \"Sorgmarsch\" (\"Dirge\") from his last album throughout the film.\n\nAgnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad:\n \nLyngstad in 1982:\nBoth female members of ABBA pursued solo careers on the international scene after their work with the group. In 1982, Lyngstad chose Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins to produce the album Something's Going On and unveiled the hit single and video \"I Know There's Something Going On\" in August of that year. The single became a number-one hit in France (where it spent five weeks at the top), Belgium, Switzerland, and Costa Rica. The track reached number three in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Poland, and was also a Top 10 hit in Germany, Italy, Finland, South Africa, and Australia. The track also proved successful in the US, peaking at No. 13 (and spending almost four months on the Billboard Hot 100). Sveriges Television documented this historical event, by filming the completely recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Lyngstad, Collins, Ulvaeus, and Andersson as well as all the musicians. This documentary and the promotion videos from the album are included in Frida – The DVD.\nLyngstad's second solo album after ABBA was called Shine, produced by Steve Lillywhite. Shine was recorded in Paris and released in 1984. Shine was Lyngstad's final studio album release for twelve years. It featured \"Slowly\", the last known Andersson-Ulvaeus composition to have been recorded by one of the former female ABBA vocalists to date. The promotion videos and clips for \"Shine\" are included in Frida – The DVD.\nIn 1980, Agnetha Fältskog and her then-7-year-old daughter Linda recorded Nu tändas tusen juleljus, a Swedish Christmas album. Released in 1981, it was Fältskog's first Swedish-language recording for the Polar Music label after she left CBS-Cupol. It peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in January 1982, has been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music in the 1990s and 2000s, and is one of the best-selling Swedish Christmas albums of all time. The album title is derived from one of Scandinavia's best-known Christmas carols, \"Nu tändas tusen juleljus\" (Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit).\n\nIn 1983, Fältskog released the solo album Wrap Your Arms Around Me which achieved platinum sales in Sweden. This included the single \"The Heat Is On\", which was a hit all over Europe and Scandinavia. It reached number-one in Sweden and Norway and number-two in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the United States, Fältskog earned a Billboard Top 30 hit with \"Can't Shake Loose\". The single \"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\" was another successful hit, topping the charts in Belgium and Denmark, reaching the Top 5 in Sweden, the Netherlands and South Africa, and the Top 20 in Germany and France. The album sold 1.2 million copies worldwide. The highly successful producer and songwriter Mike Chapman, also known for his work with the Sweet, Mud, Suzi Quatro, Blondie, Pat Benatar, and The Knack, produced the album.\n \nFältskog in 1982:\n\"It's So Nice to be Rich\" was Agnetha's fourth top ten hits in Sweden in 1983. Her duet with Tomas Ledin, \"Never Again\", was the first. Fältskog's second English-language solo album, Eyes of a Woman, was released in March 1985. It peaked at number two in Sweden (becoming a platinum seller), and performing reasonably well in Europe. Eric Stewart of 10cc produced the album. The first single from the album was her self-penned \"I Won't Let You Go\". Agnetha's duet with Ola Håkansson, \"The Way You Are\", was a number-one hit in Sweden in 1986 and was awarded double platinum status. In early 1987, Agnetha recorded an album \"Kom följ med I vår karusell\" (\"Come Join Us on Our Carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album, Agnetha recorded duets with her son and with a choir of children. She also recorded a few solo songs. The single \"På Söndag\" (\"On Sunday\") was much played on the radio and even made the Swedish top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.\n\nAlso in 1987, Fältskog released her third post-ABBA solo album, the Peter Cetera-produced I Stand Alone, which also included the Billboard Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, \"I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)\", as well as the European charting singles \"The Last Time\" and \"Let It, Shine\". The album was extremely successful in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at number-one and was awarded double-platinum. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, Fältskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career. In 1996, she released her autobiography, As I Am, and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics. In 2004, she made a successful comeback, when she released the critically acclaimed album My Colouring Book containing 1960s covers who had the most impact on her teenage years as a music contender. It debuted at number one in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), number-six in Germany, and number 12 in the UK, winning a silver award and achieving gold status in Finland. The single \"If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind\" (a cover of the Cilla Black 1960s song) became Fältskog's biggest solo hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 11. The single peaked at number two in Sweden and was a hit throughout Scandinavia and Europe. A further single, \"When You Walk in the Room\", was released but met with less success, only peaking at number 34 in the United Kingdom. In January 2007, she sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy Körberg at the after-party for the final performance of the musical, Mamma Mia!, in Stockholm, at which Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus were also present.\n\nIn 1992, Lyngstad had been asked and chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organization \"Artister för miljön\" (Artists for the Environment) in Sweden. She became chairperson for this organization from 1992 to 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the Julian Lennon song \"Saltwater\" and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for this organization led up to the decision to record again. The album Djupa andetag (Deep Breaths) was released towards the end of 1996 and became a success in Sweden, where it reached number-one. The lyrics for the single from this album, \"Även en blomma\" (\"Even a Flower\"), deal with environmental issues. In 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song called \"The Sun Will Shine Again\", written especially for her and released with former Deep Purple member Jon Lord. The couple made several TV performances with this song in Germany. Lyngstad lives a relatively low-profile life but occasionally appears at a party or charity function. On 26 August 1992, she married Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss von Plauen, of the German Reuss family. Reuss von Plauen died of lymphoma in 1999 at the age of 49. In addition to losing her husband, Lyngstad had also lost her daughter Lise-Lotte in a car crash a year earlier.\nOn 5 December 2005, Universal released her box set, Frida – 4xCD 1xDVD, consisting of the solo albums she recorded for the Polar Label and the 3​1⁄2-hour documentary Frida – The DVD. On this DVD, which covers her entire singing career, Lyngstad herself through the years guides the viewer from her TV debut in Sweden in 1967 to the TV performances she made in Germany in 2004. Many rare clips are included in the set and Lyngstad herself explains each performance. The interview with Lyngstad was filmed in the Swiss Alps in mid-2005.\n\nLyngstad returned to the recording studio in 2010 to record vocals for the Cat Stevens song \"Morning Has Broken\", for Swedish guitarist Georg Wadenius's October 2010 album Reconnection. The album, which featured other guest vocalists, reached number 17 in the Swedish charts. In May 2013, Fältskog released a solo album entitled A through Universal-International. In a promotional interview, Fältskog explained that the album was unplanned and it was after she heard the first three songs that she felt that she \"had to do this [record the album]\". She also revealed that she completed singing lessons before recording A, as she felt \"a bit rusty\" in her throat. Fältskog stated that she would not be undertaking any tours or live performances in support of the album, explaining: \"I'm not that young anymore. I don't have the energy to do that, and also I don't want to travel too much.\" The title of the album was conceived of by the studio production team. A has been very successful, earning her four Gold Records in the UK (where it peaked at number six), Australia, Germany, and Sweden. In the UK and Australia, A was in the top 100 albums of 2013. In 2018, Lyngstad and multi-Grammy-winning Jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval released a reworking of the ABBA song \"Andante, Andante\" as a single, which is also featured on Sandoval's album Ultimate Duets.\n \nArtistry - Recording process:\nABBA were perfectionists in the studio, working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back to later on. The band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer, guitarist, and bass player, and overlaid other arrangements and instruments. Vocals were then added, and orchestra overdubs were usually left until last. Fältskog and Lyngstad contributed ideas at the studio stage. Andersson and Ulvaeus played them the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions. According to Fältskog, she and Lyngstad had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped. When we gather around the piano to get our voices tuned up, we often come up with things we can use in the backing vocals.\n— Agnetha Fältskog\n \nAfter vocals and overdubs were done, the band took up to five days to mix a song.\nTheir single \"S.O.S.\" was \"heavily influenced by Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the melodies of the Beach Boys\", according to Billboard writer Fred Bronson, who also reported that Ulvaeus had said, \"Because there was the Latin-American influence, the German, the Italian, the English, the American, all of that. I suppose we were a bit exotic in every territory in an acceptable way.\"\n \nFashion, style, videos, advertising campaigns:\nABBA was widely noted for the colorful and trend-setting costumes its members wore. The reason for the wild costumes was Swedish tax law. The cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances. Choreography by Graham Tainton also contributed to their performance style. The videos that accompanied some of the band's biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Most of ABBA's videos (and ABBA: The Movie) were directed by Lasse Hallström, who would later direct the films My Life as a Dog, The Cider House Rules and Chocolat. ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible. This was also done to minimize travel, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Fältskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fältskog, who was also afraid of flying, was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realized the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicize a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos have become classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.\n \nIn 1976, ABBA participated in an advertising campaign to promote the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s brand, National, in Australia. The campaign was also broadcast in Japan. Five commercial spots, each of approximately one minute, were produced, each presenting the \"National Song\" performed by ABBA using the melody and instrumental arrangements of \"Fernando\" and revised lyrics.\n \nPolitical position:\nIn September 2010, band members Andersson and Ulvaeus criticized the right-wing Danish People's Party (DF) for using the ABBA song \"Mamma Mia\" (with modified lyrics) at rallies. The band threatened to file a lawsuit against the DF, saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had no interest in supporting the party. Their record label Universal Music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached.\n \nSuccess in the United States:\nDuring their active career, from 1972 to 1982, ABBA placed twenty singles on the Billboard Hot 100, fourteen of which made the top 40 (13 on the Cashbox Top 100) and ten of which made the Top 20 on both charts. A total of four of those singles reached the Top 10, including \"Dancing Queen\" which reached number-one in April 1977. While \"Fernando\" and \"SOS\" did not break the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, reaching number 13 and 15 respectively, they did reach the Top 10 on Cashbox (\"Fernando\") and Record World (\"SOS\") charts. Both \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Take A Chance On Me\" were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies each.\n \nThe group also had 12 Top 20 singles on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart with two of them, \"Fernando\" and \"The Winner Takes It All\", reaching number one. \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" was ABBA's fourth number-one single on a Billboard chart, topping the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Nine ABBA albums made their way into the top half of the Billboard 200 album chart, with seven of them reaching the Top 50 and four reaching the Top 20. ABBA: The Album was the highest-charting album of the group's career, peaking at No. 14. Five albums received RIAA gold certification (more than 500,000 copies sold), while three acquired platinum status (selling more than one million copies).\n\nThe album, Gold – Greatest Hits, was released in the United States in 1993. It topped the Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in August 2008, is the group's first number one album ever on any of the Billboard album charts. It sold 6x Platinum (1x Platinum = one million copies). On 15 March 2010, Bee Gees members Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb inducted ABBA into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The ceremony was held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson represented the group.\n\nStudio albums\n\n- Ring Ring -  (1973)\n- Waterloo -  (1974)\n- ABBA -  (1975)\n- Arrival -  (1976)\n- The Album -  (1977)\n- Voulez-Vous -  (1979)\n- Super Trouper -  (1980)\n- The Visitors -  (1981)\n- Voyage -  (2021) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ABBA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand), known professionally as Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Taking inspiration from aristocracy for her stage name, she is known for employing unconventional musical styles and introspective songwriting. Lorde's music is primarily electropop and contains elements of subgenres such as dream pop and indie-electro.\n\nShe released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013, and her first single, Royals, in June 2013. Her debut album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013, and was followed by Melodrama in 2017.  She chose her stage name due to her fascination with \"royals and aristocracy\".\n\nLorde was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father, an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland.\n\nAt the age of 12, she was spotted by A&R scout Scott Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O'Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in 2012.\n\nOfficially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit \"Royals\". On May 27 2013, \"Royals\" was covered on national television on the New Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. \"Royals\" debuted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In the U.S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts as a lead singer.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, The Love Club EP debuted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996. Following the release of \"Royals\" in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, \"I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right\". In November 2013, her song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was included on the soundtrack of the movie \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and Men, and Imagine Dragons among others.\n\nThe single \"Tennis Court\" was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The \"Tennis Court EP\" was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles final. On 14 June 2013, \"Tennis Court\" debuted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart. In the same week, she also became the first New Zealand artist to simultaneously have four songs in the top 20 tracks of the New Zealand Top 40. Previously, Titanium held this record with three songs.\n\n2014 - Major Awards continue \nLorde's success continued in 2014, picking up major awards at:\n- the 56th Grammy Awards - \"Song of The Year\" for \"Royals\" and also \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\" (Los Angeles, January 2014). \n- the BRIT Awards - International Female Solo Artist (London, February 2014).\n- the inaugural iHeartRadio Awards - Best New Artist (Los Angeles, May 2014). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. Noted for her distinctive raspy voice, her music spans a range of styles, from pop and country pop to hip hop, experimental and rock. Cyrus is the best-selling artist born in the 1990s, and has attained the most US Billboard 200 top-five albums in the 21st century by a female artist, with a total of thirteen entries. Her personal life, public image, and performances have often sparked controversy and received widespread media coverage.\n\nShe gained fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana, which began in 2006 and ended in 2010. Cyrus recorded music for the soundtracks Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records, which helped establish her as a teen idol. In 2007, Cyrus signed to Hollywood Records for a solo career. She went on the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year; the tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film entitled Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008).\n\nIn April 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which experienced international success and she was included in Time magazine's 2008 Top 100. She began her foray into films by providing the voice of \"Penny\" in the animated film Bolt (2008) and by reprising the role of Miley in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). Bolt's theme song, \"I Thought I Lost You\", earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Hannah Montana: The Movie' soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets.\n\nShe began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), a mainstream pop extended play, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus's best-selling single, \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009). Cyrus ranked number twenty-nine on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100. Her studio album Can't Be Tamed was released in 2010. The music video and lyrics of the album's lead single, \"Can't Be Tamed\", portrayed a more sexualized image for the entertainer.\n\nIn 2013, Cyrus took a different musical direction in her career, working with R&B and hip hop producers on “Bangerz”, her first album on RCA Records; this album also marked a deep public image change to her, releasing more provocative music videos and lyrics, talking about sex, parties, and drugs. This continued with her next album “Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz”, with a more experimental sound but still with provocative lyrics and music videos. For her next studio album  \"Younger Now\" (2017), she returned to her country-pop music roots and a cleaner image compared to her two previous albums.\n\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles (born September 4, 1981 in Houston, Texas) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Beyoncé is often cited as an influence by other artists.\n\nBorn and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé began performing in local competitions at age 7, eventually forming the group Girl's Tyme in 1990 with help from her parents. Girl's Tyme became Destiny's Child in 1997. \n\nDuring the hiatus of Destiny's Child in 2003, Beyoncé released her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love, which became one of the most successful albums of that year, and signaled her viability as a solo artist. The disbanding of Destiny's Child in 2005 facilitated her continued success: her sophomore solo album B'Day, released in 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Her third solo album, I Am… Sasha Fierce, was released in November 2008, and in 2009 she received 10 Grammy Awards nominations. On January 31, 2010, she won 6 Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night; she previously held the record of five awards with 5 other artists. Following a career hiatus, Beyoncé released her fourth studio album entitled \"4\" on June 24, 2011, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. \n\n2013 - 5th Album - \"Beyoncé\"\nOn December 12, 2013, Beyoncé unexpectedly released her fifth and self-titled album in the iTunes Store. Beyoncé called it a \"visual album\" as it includes 14 songs and 18 videos - with each track having a music video together with additional bonus videos. The album has a list of collaborators including Drake, Frank Ocean and her husband, Jay-Z, and daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\n2015\nIn February 2015 at the 57th Grammy Awards, Beyoncé won 3 Grammys (and was nominated for 6 Grammy awards) - Best R&B Song for \"Drunk in Love\", Best R&B Performance and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé.\n\nOn April 4th, 2015, Beyoncé surprised her fans with the release of a new single and accompanying video, released exclusively on the streaming service \"Tidal\" which she co-owns with a number of other big name starts including Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Jack White, Kanye West, Madonna, Rihanna and Usher. The track, \"Die With You\" is a stripped down ballad, with Beyoncé sitting at a piano with pigtail braids: the song celebrates the seventh anniversary of her marriage to Jay-Z.\n\nSuper Bowl - February 2016\nBeyoncé appeared on stage to perform her latest single \"Formation\", supporting the headline act Coldplay at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. Also appearing on stage was Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson who performed their hit \"Uptown Funk\".\n\n2016 - 6th Album - \"Lemonade\"\n\"Lemonade\" is Beyoncé's sixth solo album and was released on April 23, 2016 as an exclusive on the music streaming service, Tidal after it premiered on the TV Network, HBO, as a conceptual short film. It was subsequently made available for purchase on Apple's iTunes Store on April 24, 2016. The album has 12 tracks, with contributions from artists such as James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. According to a press release from Tidal which accompanied the release, \"Lemonade\" is “based on every woman’s journey of self-knowledge and healing”.\n\n2017 - Grammy Awards\nAt the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Beyoncé took awards for \"Best Urban Contemporary Album\" for \"Lemonade\"and \"Best Music Video\" for \"Formation\"\n\nMiscellaneous\nBeyoncé began her acting career in 2001, appearing in the musical film Carmen: A Hip Hopera. In 2006, she starred in the lead role in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls, for which she earned two Golden Globe nominations. \n\nOn April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were married in a small, private ceremony in New York. On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.\n\nBeyoncé launched her family's fashion line, House of Deréon, in 2004, and has endorsed such brands as Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani and L'Oréal. \n\nIn 2009, Forbes listed Beyoncé fourth on its list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the world, third on its list of the top-grossing musicians, and number one on the list of top Best-Paid Celebs Under 30 with over $87 million dollars in earnings between 2008 and 2009.\n\nBeyoncé has attained five Hot 100 number one singles, becoming one of the two female artists—joint with Rihanna—with the most number ones attained within the 2000s, excluding her three Hot 100 number one singles with Destiny's Child. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Beyonc%C3%A9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Clairo is the stage name for singer-songwriter Claire Cottrill, whose song \"Pretty Girl\" went viral in late 2017 on YouTube. She is the daughter of Geoff Cottrill, a famous marketer who held high-ranking positions at Converse, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble. At 19 years old, Clairo opened a show for rapper Tyler, the Creator and had her music featured on The Le Sigh, a blog for female and nonbinary rising musicians. A freshman at Syracuse University, Clairo plans to abandon her lo-fi bedroom pop phase and become a full-fledged pop musician with the aid of Danny L. Harle. \n\nOn May 25, 2018, Claire released the EP \"Diary 001\", featuring 6 tracks, many of which were previously released as singles. The EP featured Clairo's characteristic lo-fi production and bedroom pop aesthetic. Claire described the EP as being a compilation of many of the tracks she made in her first few years of making music. \n\nOn August 2, 2019, Claire released her debut studio album under FADER Label titled \"Immunity\". The album featured production from not only Claire but also Rostam Batmanglij of Vampire Weekend fame, who also contributed to songwriting. Featuring 11 tracks, 3 of which were released as singles, the album explores Claire's personal life, including her struggles with mental illness and sexuality. \"Immunity\" blends Claire's lo-fi, bedroom pop style along with more elements of traditional pop and expands upon it, creating a distinctive sound from much of her earlier work. The LP earned a spot in the top albums of 2019 from many publications, including Billboard, Pitchfork, and The Guardian. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clairo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Fleetwood Mac is a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect (later known as Christine McVie), who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.\n\nPrimarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with \"Albatross\", and had other hits such as the singles \"Oh Well\" and \"Man of the World\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.\n\nThe addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of Bill Clinton featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.\n\nFleetwood Mac has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nDanny Kirwan, guitarist, songwriter and early member of Fleetwood Mac (1968–1972) died in London, England, on 8 June 2018, aged 68. An obituary in The New York Times said he had died in his sleep after contracting pneumonia earlier in the year. The British music magazine Mojo quoted Christine McVie as saying: \"Danny Kirwan was the white English blues guy. Nobody else could play like him. He was a one-off ... Danny and Peter [Green] gelled so well together. Danny had a very precise, piercing vibrato – a unique sound ... He was a perfectionist; a fantastic musician and a fantastic writer.\" One of Kirwan's songs, \"Tell Me All the Things You Do\" from the 1970 album Kiln House, was included in the set of the 2018–19 An Evening with Fleetwood Mac tour.\n\nOn 28 May 2020 Neil Finn, featuring Nicks and McVie, with Campbell on guitar, released the song “Find Your Way Back Home” for the Auckland, New Zealand homeless shelter Auckland City Mission. \n\nFounding member Peter Green died on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73. In October 2020, Rumours again entered the Billboard top 10. The album received 30.6 million plays on streaming platforms the week of October 15, after a TikTok video of the song \"Dreams\" went viral. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Karly-Marina Loaiza, professionally known as Kali Uchis, is a Colombian-American singer-songwriter, record producer, music video director and fashion designer. She writes and produces most of her own music.\n\nThe stylistic range of left-field pop artist Kali Uchis is reflected in the variety of her collaborators – an extensive genre-crossing list that includes Tyler, the Creator, Gorillaz, Daniel Caesar, Juanes, and BadBadNotGood. A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Daniel Caesar's \"Get You\" and Juanes' \"El Ratico.\"\n\nKali Uchis experienced the majority of her upbringing in Virginia and also spent time in her parents' native Colombia. As a teenager growing up in Alexandria, just south of Washington, D.C., she learned to play piano and saxophone and also developed a deep interest in visual arts. Her recorded debut was made in 2012 with the self-released mixtape Drunken Babble. Within three years, she had several singles to her credit, including \"Know What I Want\" and \"Lottery,\" typically promoted with videos she directed, as well as collaborations with Snoop Dogg, GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, and Major Lazer. Following the 2015 independent release of Por Vida, a free digital-download EP with tracks produced by Diplo, Kaytranada, and Tyler, Uchis started releasing her material through major-label Virgin EMI. A DJ Dahi-tweaked version of Por Vida's \"Ridin Round,\" issued that November after a move to Los Angeles, was the artist's first single for the major label. \"Only Girl,\" a relaxed Kaytranada production featuring Vince Staples and the Internet's Steve Lacy, followed in April 2016. She was also featured that year on Daniel Caesar's \"Get You.\"\n\nThroughout 2017, Uchis added to her discography of featured appearances via tracks by Juanes, Gorillaz, Tyler, Bootsy Collins, and Miguel, and she previewed her debut album with the singles \"Tyrant\" (featuring Jorja Smith) and \"Nuestro Planeta\" (featuring Reykon). By the end of the year, \"Get You\" had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance, and Juanes' \"El Ratico\" made Uchis a Latin Grammy nominee when it was up for Record of the Year. January 2018 saw the release of the BadBadNotGood-produced single \"After the Storm\" (featuring Tyler and Bootsy). Uchis released her debut album, Isolation, three months later. It debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and entered the R&B/hip-hop chart at number four.\n\nhttp://kaliuchis.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kali+Uchis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Strokes is an American rock band from  Manhattan, New York, United States, formed in 1998. The band rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group in garage rock/post-punk revival. The band consists of Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick Valensi (lead guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion).\n\t \nUpon the release of their debut album, Is This It, in 2001, the group was met with much critical acclaim, being hailed by some as the \"saviors of rock and roll.\" NME made Is This It their Album of the Year. Since then, the band has maintained a large fan base, notably in the UK, US and Australia. As of 2007, Is This It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.\n\t \nThey released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003, to good reviews, but to less success commercially, although it still went gold. The album's sound maintained the Strokes' familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as The Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007.\n\t \nIn late September 2005, \"Juicebox\", the first single from The Strokes then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became The Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world.\n\nTheir third album, First Impressions of Earth, was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band. In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\".\n\t \nThe Strokes' frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing new material for their band's forthcoming new album in the latter stages of January 2009, which they were set to go in the studio to finalize in February of the same year. In February 2010, Julian Casablancas told NME that the band's fourth album was set to be released in September 2010. The release date has been pushed back again, and the album, titled \"Angles\" will now be released March 22, 2011 in America. The album's first single, \"Under Cover of Darkness\" was made available as a free download from the band's website on February 9, 2011 for a 48 hour period.\n\nThe Strokes' fifth album is called \"Comedown Machine\" and was released on March 26th 2013 In North America and March 25th in the U.K. The first single is called \"All the Time\". \n\nThey released their first collection of material after their departure from RCA, the Future Present Past EP, in June 2016 through Casablancas' independent Cult Records label.\n\nLater that decade, the Strokes began working with Rick Rubin on a new album. In April 2020 they released their first studio album in seven years, The New Abnormal, through Cult and RCA. Critics generally considered the album a return to form.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.thestrokes.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single \"Mic Drop\". The band is the first Korean act to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the Soul: Persona (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year, and the fastest to earn three number one albums since The Monkees in 1967. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.\n\nAccording to Gaon Music Chart, BTS has sold fifteen million albums domestically and is the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s. They hold the best-selling album in Korean history with Map of the Soul: Persona. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards. Featured on Time's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. During their 2019 Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. BTS are worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, attracting one in every 13 foreign tourists that visit the country, and are cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018, a figure not seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF, BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd General Assembly and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/BTS\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock and psychedelic rock. The band consists of co-founders Anthony Kiedis (lead vocals) and Flea (bass), as well as drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante, the latter of whom has been in the band across three stints. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time. They are the most successful band in the history of alternative rock, with the records for most number-one singles (13), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.\n\nWith new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded Mother's Milk (1989) and their first major commercial success, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, Californication (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful; Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on I'm with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th album, Unlimited Love, in 2022.\n\nThe Chili Peppers' mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock and nu metal. Kiedis said the band were early to combine \"hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals\", and suggested they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Linkin Park. Smith said, \"Certainly Anthony's singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it's hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I'm proud of that because sometimes bands don't have that strong personality where you go, 'Oh, that's boom, right away.'\"\n\nThe Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame In April 2012. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez; Frusciante was invited, but did not attend. Navarro and Sherman were not inducted; Sherman said he felt \"dishonored\". The band performed \"By the Way\", \"Give It Away\" and \"Higher Ground\", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in more than 20 years.\n\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone released their first list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", with Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 310 and Californication at 399. In 2012, a revised list was released, with Californication at 401. In 2020, Rolling Stone released another version of the list, with Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 186 and Californication at 286.\n\nThe band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 31, 2022. George Clinton, Woody Harrelson and Bob Forrest unveiled the star at the ceremony. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBorn in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released Station to Station. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer two days after the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They self-released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by Fueled By Ramen in 2012. Whilst being signed by Fueled by Ramen, they released three studio albums - their signed debut album Vessel (2013), Blurryface (2015), and  Trench (2018). Their 6th studio album, Scaled and Icy, was released on May 21, 2021, and is currently their latest release.\n\nTyler Joseph and Josh Dun have earned widespread acclaim for their energetic live sets and distinctive fusion of piano-driven pop and lyrical uplift. No strangers to the road, Twenty One Pilots have built a fervent global following due to their electrifying live performances at innumerable headline shows and tours.\n\nJoseph arrived to the band's name while studying the play All My Sons by Arthur Miller. The story centers around a World War II man who, for the good of his business and reputation, makes a tough decision to knowingly send out faulty airplane parts. \"Twenty one pilots'\" died as a result. Tyler explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration for the band's name. On December 29, 2009, Twenty One Pilots released their debut, self-titled album and began touring Ohio.\n\nIn mid-2011, bassist Nick Thomas and drummer Chris Salih sequentially left due to busy schedules, both posting farewell notes on the band's Facebook page. Joseph was then joined by Josh Dun, former live drummer of House of Heroes. On July 8, 2011, Joseph and Dun released a second independent album, Regional At Best.\n\nSince signing to Fueled By Ramen in 2012, the duo have released their major label debut Vessel in January of 2013, and its explosively popular follow-up Blurryface in May of 2015.\n\nTwo new singles from the band, named \"Jumpsuit\" and \"Nico and the Niners\", were simultaneously released on July 11, 2018. A third single, named \"My Blood\", was released on August 27. Their third debut album, titled Trench, was released on October 5, 2018.\n\nA promotional single, named \"Level of Concern\", was released on April 9, 2020. In that same year, the duo released another single titled \"Christmas Saves the Year\" on December 8.\n\nA single leading up to their sixth album Scaled and Icy, titled \"Shy Away,\" was released April 8, 2021 along with a music video. A second single leading up to the release of Scaled and Icy, titled \"Choker\", was released April 29, 2021, along with a music video. Their third single \"Saturday\" was released on May 18, 2021. The rest of the album was released three days afterwards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "One Direction (commonly abbreviated to 1D) is a UK-Irish boy group, active from 2010 until going on hiatus in 2016. The original 5-member group was made up of Liam Payne (born 29 August 1993) from Wolverhampton, Louis Tomlinson (born 24 December 1991) from Doncaster, Niall Horan (born 13th September 1993) from Mullingar, Westmeath, Ireland, Harry Styles, (born 1 February 1994) from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire and Zayn Malik, (born 12 January 1993) from East Bowling, Bradford: Zayn Malik announced he was to leave the group on March 25, 2015, and the remainder of the group confirmed they would continue as a 4-piece band. They applied as solo candidates on the 2010 edition of the X Factor, but the judges, after a suggestion by Simon Cowell, put them in a band in London, UK; therefore qualifying for the Groups category.\n\nOne Direction's first single, What Makes You Beautiful, received its first airplay on August 10, 2011 and was released a month later on September 11, 2011. It was the fastest selling single of the year 2011 and peaked at #1 on the UK Singles Chart. The boys released their second single Gotta Be You on November 13th peaking at #3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their album Up All Night followed on November 21st reaching #2 on the UK Albums Chart, narrowly missing out on #1 to Rihanna. When their album Up All Night was released in the USA, it debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, setting the record for the highest-selling debut album by a British boy band.\n\nTickets for their first headlining UK tour went on sale October 1st 2011 and all 22 dates sold out within 12 minutes.\n\nMalik Exits One Direction (March 2015)\nOn March 25th, 2015, Zayn Malik announced he was to leave the band. Commenting on his exit from the band, he said \"My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band\". \n\nA Band Break-(up?) from March 2016\nOn Aug 23, 2015, The Sun newspaper in the UK reported that the band would \"take a break\" from March 2016, after they finish promoting their fifth studio album Made in the A.M.. A source said, \"The guys have been together for five years, which is an incredible run for any boy band. They fully deserve to have at least a year to work on their own projects. There is absolutely no bad blood between them and they are all 100% behind the decision. It is definitely not a split and they fully intend to get back together at some time in the future.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born in Cambridge and raised in Start Hill, Essex, she began posting songs on Myspace in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse raves and parties. In 2010, she signed a recording contract with Asylum Records, releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Charli XCX rose to prominence with the Icona Pop collaboration \"I Love It\", which became an international success, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, True Romance (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the chorus and hook to \"Fancy\" by rapper Iggy Azalea, which finished the year as one of the best-selling singles worldwide and was nominated for two Grammy Awards. The same year, Charli XCX released \"Boom Clap\", which became her first solo top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100. Her second studio album, the pop/rock-influenced Sucker, was released at the end of the year, and spawned the successful singles \"Break the Rules\" and \"Doing It\".\n\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working with producers and artists in A. G. Cook's British collective PC Music, as well as producer Sophie. While working on her third album, she released the Vroom Vroom EP in 2016 and the mixtapes Number 1 Angel and Pop 2 in 2017, as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"After the Afterparty\", \"Boys\", and \"1999\". In 2019, Charli XCX released her third studio album, Charli, which was followed by her fourth studio album, How I'm Feeling Now, which she recorded and released during the UK's first national lockdown in 2020.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists including Camila Cabello, Rita Ora, Selena Gomez, and many more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Britney Jean Spears  (born December 2, 1981 in McComb, MS) is an American singer, songwriter and dancer. She is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which she is referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\". Regarded as a pop icon, Spears has sold nearly 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million solely in the United States, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.\n\nShe has officially released nine studio albums to date: ...Baby One More Time (1999), Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), Britney (2001), In the Zone (2003), Blackout (2007), Circus (2008), Femme Fatale (2011), Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016).\n\nAlong with 2 official compilation albums, 2 official remixes albums and 1 official extended play: \"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\" (2004), \"B In The Mix: The Remixes\" (2005), \"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\" (2005), \"The Singles Collection\" (2009) and  \"B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2\" (2011).\n\nAs a child, Spears performed as a cast member of The New Mickey Mouse Club from 1993 to 1994, along with Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.\n\nIn September 2004, she married Kevin Federline. The couple had two sons, Sean (born September 2005) and Jayden (born September 2006). Spears filed for divorce in November 2006.\n\nBritney's debut album' ...Baby One More Time' was a huge commercial success. It debuted at number one in the U.S. with 120,500 copies sold in its first week on the Billboard 200, where it remained for 6 non-consecutive weeks, and it also debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in many other countries. The record has been certified 14× Platinum in the United States. It is the highest selling album by a teenager both in the US and worldwide. The album also spent fifty-one weeks in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200 and sixty weeks in the top twenty. With this, it became the second best-selling album of 1999, selling 8,358,619 in the United States, only behind Backstreet Boys' 'Millennium'. It stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years until it was moved to the Pop Catalog chart.  According to the RIAA, it is the 27th best-selling album in American music history, and 4th best-selling album by a female artist. This album, its lyrics, and its music videos maintained the typical virgin image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears.\n\nFollowing the success of her debut album, Spears released the album 'Oops!... I Did It Again' in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the U.S. by selling 1,319,193 units during its first week of sales, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest album sales in its debut week by any solo artist. The RIAA awarded the album with a diamond certification with 10 million copies sold in the U.S.\n\nSpears released her third studio album 'Britney' in November 2001. Although not as successful as her previous albums, she assumed some creative control by co-writing five of the album's tracks. It surpassed Michael Jackson's album 'Invincible' when it had a successful debut at number one in the U.S. by selling 745,744 units during its first week.  The album's success made her the only female artist in music history to have her first three albums debut at number one.\n\nBritney also became a Pepsi spokesperson in 2001, earning a $7-8 million endorsement deal. For the \"We Will Rock You\" Pepsi campaign, featuring Pink, Beyonce and Enrique Iglesias, Britney received $9.27 million. \n\n2002 found Britney in her first movie role, the somewhat biographical Crossroads.  \n\nSpears released her fourth studio album 'In the Zone' in November 2003, jettisoning the Max Martin-produced synthpop of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as RedZone and big names including Moby and R. Kelly. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. 'In the Zone' reached number one in the U.S. charts during its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the first female in the Nielsen SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.  All three singles, Me Against The Music, Toxic and Everytime, reached #1 on the Australian ARIA charts.  'Toxic' became one of Britney's signature songs and the video is considered by most to be her best.\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to back-up dancer Kevin Federline.  She and Federline were married on September 18 that same year.  She also released a fragrance in September 2004, entitled Curious, and another, Fantasy, the following year. In early 2006, she released the limited edition fragrance In Control Curious.  She released two more fragrances in 2007 and 2009 : Believe and Hidden Fantasy.\n\nNovember 2004 saw the release of her first greatest hits collection, 'Greatest Hits: My Prerogative', which features all of Spears's singles up to 'Outrageous' with the exception of \"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\". It also featured three previously unreleased songs, a cover version of American R&B singer Bobby Brown's 1988 hit \"My Prerogative\", \"Do Somethin'\", produced by Bloodshy and Avant, whom she had worked with on In The Zone, and \"I've Just Begun (Havin' My Fun)\", which was a song recorded for Spears's fourth album, In The Zone, but did not make the final cut. By the end of that year, Spears had become one of the best-selling artists in the world.\n\nSpears and her now husband Kevin, starred in their own reality television show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic in the first half of 2005. In the final episode of the show, Spears debuted the single Someday (I Will Understand) but the song and video were not released in the US. 'Britney & Kevin: Chaotic...' the bonus CD, includes Mona Lisa and Over To You Now. \n\nIn November 2005, Spears released her first remix album, B In The Mix: The Remixes. The songs ranged from  \"...Baby One More Time\" to \"Toxic\". Her newest single \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" was also remixed.  Another single, \"And Then We Kiss\", was only released in Asia, where it charted in many countries. The song peaked at number 15 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart despite it not being officially released in the U.S.  It also peaked at #13 on Australia's Hot 30 Countdown despite not being officially released.\n\nIn 2005, she won her first Grammy award for 'Best Dance Recording' for her song \"Toxic\".  On September 14, 2005, Spears gave birth to her first child, a boy, named Sean Preston.  \n\nShe appeared as a guest on Will and Grace in 2006. During an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in May 2006, she announced that she was expecting once again.  On September 12, 2006 Spears gave birth to her second child, a son named Jayden James. \n \nOn November 6, 2006 Spears filed for divorce from husband Kevin Federline. The divorce was finalized on July 30, 2007.  During 2007,  Britney continually lost more and more custody of her children, until her mental breakdown, which resulted in her taking Jayden hostage in a bathroom for over three hours, in Jan 08 stripped her of any visitations whatsoever for over a month.  Visitations after the month were heavily monitored.\n\nOn October 30, 2007 Spears released her 5th studio album entitled \"Blackout\" with its first single \"Gimme More\" being performed at the MTV Video Music Awards.  \"Gimme More was Britney's most successful single on the Billboard Hot 100 by peak position since \"...Baby One More Time\". The next two singles from \"Blackout\" were 'Piece of Me' and 'Break The Ice'.   Britney did minimal promotion for the album and it's singles.   For Gimme More, she filmed a music video and performed at the 2007 VMAs.  For Piece of Me, she filmed a music video.  For Break The Ice, an animated video was made.\n\nOn September 7, 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards for the third time. Although having not performed, a skit with Jonah Hill was pre-taped, as well as an introduction speech to the official opening of the show. Spears won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video Of The Year for \"Piece of Me\".\n\nOn September 15, Jive released a statement announcing the title of her sixth studio album, Circus, as well as the first single, Womanizer. The single was released to radio stations on September 26, and the release date for the album was December 2, Spears' 27th birthday.  The album was released in Australia on the 29th of November and in various European countries on the 27th.  Britney heavily promoted the album with various performances around the world, a documentary on her life since recovering from her breakdown and an upcoming world tour.\n\nMTV signed a deal with Spears and Jive records to release a documentary titled 'For the Record', which aired on November 30, 2008, two days before the release of Circus.  The documentary was shot over three months and featured Britney discussing her personal life as well as her career. \n\nCircus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 505,000 copies in its first week. This became Spears' fifth number one album, making her the only act in Nielsen SoundScan history to have four albums debuted with 500,000 copies or more.  It is also Spears' second album, the first being ...'Baby One More Time', to have charted two top-ten singles as \"Circus\", the follow up single to the number-one hit \"Womanizer\", debuted at number three on the Hot 100, making it her highest debut on the chart as well as her seventh top ten hit.\n\nWomanizer was her first #1 track on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" since ...Baby One More Time and made a new digital download record beating Touch My Body.  It also held the record for biggest jump, going from #96 to #1.  Kelly Clarkson has since beaten that record.\n\nIn March, Spears launched her seventh tour to promote her Circus album.  The Circus Starring: Britney Spears began its run on March 3, 2009 in Spears's home state of Louisiana.  Opening night, as well as every following show in North America, sold out.  The tour spans through North America (two legs), Europe, and Australia (first time touring ever).  Britney is accompanied by her children on the tour, and they are in her custody for over 50% of the time for the duration of the tour while ex-husband Kevin trails her.  \n\nIn April 2009, Spears declared her support for same-sex marriage to the media, following the controversial incident on Miss USA where contestant Carrie Prejean, representing California, expressed her disapproval of same-sex unions. The message left by Spears on her Twitter page read “Love is love! People should be able to do whatever makes them happy!”  After years of absence, Forbes magazine listed Spears as the 13th most powerful celebrity and the second most top-earning young musician as she made $35 million from June 2008 to June 2009. \n\nIn July 2009, Spears confirmed through her Twitter that she has begun recording new material, stating that she was going into the studio with producer Max Martin.  Also producer and remixer Russ Castella posted a message on Twitter stating that he is working on a track titled \"Dirty Girl\" for Spears.  Castella also announced that the track he is working on would be released later in 2009.  \n\nIn September 2009, Britney won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video for Womanizer.\n\nIn October of 2009, Spears released the song \"3\" to iTunes. It stayed at #1 on their charts for thirteen days and debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was the first song to do so in three years and the first song by a non-American Idol singer to have a song debut at  #1 in eleven years.\n\nIn November 2009, Spears completed the Circus Starring: Britney Spears tour. Whilst there was controversy caused by her lip-synching to her shows, other reviews and ticket sales still were strong.\n\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale. Max Martin and Dr. Luke executive produced the album and the album's first single \"Hold It Against Me\". The single debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. This gave Spears her fourth number-one single on the chart, and made her only the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey. The album peaked at number one in the United States (selling 276,000 copies), Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. The album's peak in the United States ties Britney with  Mariah Carey and  Janet Jackson  for the third-most number ones among women. Femme Fatale has sold over 590,000 copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album received positive critical reviews after its release, receiving a score of 67 on Metacritic, her highest critical score since Oops!... I Did It Again, with many critics naming the album one of Spears's best. In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix to the song \"S&M\" by Rihanna after Rihanna asked her fans via Twitter who they wanted her to collaborate with. The song reached number one in the US in mid-April 2011, giving Britney her fifth number one on the chart. In early May, Spears' second single from Femme Fatale, \"Till The World Ends\", reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and had ninety-eight million audience impressions on the Billboard chart, granting Spears the highest weekly audience of her 13-year chart career. Femme Fatale's third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached the top forty on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 2011. Among females in the last thirteen years, Spears now has the third-most top forty hits, with twenty-one. In August, the single managed to reach the top-ten on the Billboard Hot 100, which is the first time for Spears to have three songs from one album in the top-ten. On the week ending September 24, 2011, \"I Wanna Go\" moved 2-1 on the mainstream top 40, becoming her sixth number-one on that chart (making her tied for third all-time) and her first number-one and third top-ten pop song for Femme Fatale. Spears now has the longest span of number ones on the mainstream top 40, with a length of twelve years, seven months, and four days.\n\nOn March 2011, Spears announced that she would tour throughout the United States during summer 2011. The Femme Fatale Tour opened June 16 at the Power Balance Pavilion in Sacramento, California to positive reviews. Many critics noted that Spears sang more of the concert live in response to lip-synching accusations during The Circus Starring Britney Spears, and that the dancing is some of her best in years. The first ten US dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year. The tour travelled to Europe and South and Central America later in 2011. On August 12, Spears announced that her performances at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto will be taped to air on the EPIX television channel and for a DVD release, resulting in the doubling of traffic to EPIX social sites and 'Britney Spears' becoming a worldwide trending topic on Twitter.

        "content": "1)Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known mononymously as MARINA and previously by the stage name Marina and the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer-songwriter.\n\nMarina was born on the 10th October 1985 in Abergavenny, Wales. She began creating and producing her own music in 2005. In 2007, she released her debut EP, Mermaid vs. Sailor. She released her first single (a double A-side, Obsessions/Mowgli's Road) through Neon Gold Records on the 14th February 2009, closely followed by The Crown Jewels EP in June 2009.  Now signed to 679 Recordings, her first single with the label was \"Mowgli's Road\", released in November 2009. In January 2010 she reached  number two on the BBC Sound of 2010 poll list. This was followed by the release of her debut full-length studio album, The Family Jewels on the 22nd February 2010, and her debut American release, The American Jewels EP on the 25th May 2010. \n\nDiamandis' musical style ranges from keyboard-based ballads to more up-tempo new wave-style songs with full band backing. She has cited a wide range of influences such as Daniel Johnston, Blondie, Patti Smith,  Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Elliott Smith, Dolly Parton, Britney Spears and Madonna.\n\nHer second studio album was preceded by its lead single \"Primadonna\" in April 2012; the song is notable for being Diamandis's highest-charting track on the UK Singles Chart, where it reached number 11. The final product Electra Heart is a concept album lyrically united by the ideas of \"female identity\" and \"a recent breakup\". Diamandis created the titular character \"Electra Heart\" as a protagonist for the project; she portrays the personas \"Teen Idle\", \"Primadonna\", \"Homewrecker\", and \"Housewife\", which represent several female archetypes of stereotypical American culture. The project was released on 27 April 2012, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 21,358 copies. It became Diamandis's first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom, although at the time it was additionally distinguished as the lowest-selling number-one record of the 21st century in the country.\n\nAfter spending one month in New York City, Diamandis announced in February 2013 that she had begun writing material for an upcoming third studio album. The single \"Froot\" was released on 10 October 2014, her 29th birthday, and announced as the title track. Froot is the third studio album by Welsh singer Marina Diamandis and her last under the stage name Marina and the Diamonds.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, Marina announced the lead single from her fourth album. Handmade Heaven was released one week later on February 8. In order to promote the release of her new album, Marina released three further singles before the album's release, Superstar, Orange Trees and To Be Human. \nMarina's fourth studio album, \"Love + Fear\", was released in full on 26th April 2019, and this is her first album under the mononym MARINA. \nDiamandis released an acoustic companion EP,  Love + Fear (Acoustic), on 13 September 2019.[6]\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Marina released the lead single, Man’s World, of her fifth and most recent album Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land. Album includes singles such as Purge The Poison, the title track Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land and Venus Fly Trap\n\nAlmost 7 months after its release, the deluxe version of the album was released with three new tracks, Happy Loner, Pink Convertible, Free Woman and two voice demos.\n\n* Official site\n\n2) Marina Lima was known by the name Marina in the start of her career in 1980's. Since 90's she has used her full name, Marina Lima. Lima is a Brazilian rock singer.\nStarting her career before Brazilian rock of the '80s was commercially ripe, Marina Lima witnessed its creation from a privileged standpoint and participated in it as a successful pop star since 1984. Her most regular partner has been her brother, philosopher Antônio Cícero. Her biggest hits are \"Fullgás\" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), \"À Francesa\" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), \"Pra Começar\" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), \"Nada Por Mim\" (Herbert Viana/Paula Toller), \"Eu Te Amo Você\" (Kiko Zambianchi), \"Ainda É Cedo,\" \"Não Sei Dançar,\" and \"Uma Noite e Meia.\" Her eclectic repertory features rock-tinged pop-dance music, blues, bossa nova, a typical samba-canção melancholy, and a very tiny pinch of jazz.\nFrom five to 12, she lived in the U.S. where her father worked, and was taught to read in English before Portuguese. Attracted to psychoanalysis and music, Marina Lima (just Marina by then; she added her surname to her stage name in the '90s) started to write songs, opting for making a living in this career when Gal Costa recorded her \"Meu Doce Amor\" in 1977. The next year she formed a band that had a drummer who would be connected with the creation and the development of the Brazilian rock of the '80s, Lobão. Ricardo Barreto (guitar), Guto Barros (guitar), Zé Luís (sax), and Junno Homrich (bass) would also participate in that historic moment (they later became musicians of the seminal Brazilian rock band Blitz) as they were also in her band before the new genre took Brazil. Marina's first solo album, Simples Como Fogo (1979), already brought originals in the pop/rock style that would become mainstream in the next decade. But her first hit came in 1984, with \"Fullgás,\" which had success with the title track \"Me Chama\" (Lobão) and \"Mesmo que Seja Eu\" (Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos, here having its meaning altered as a confession of her bisexuality). Three years later, she appeared in the film Rádio Pirata (Lael Rodrigues) singing the main theme, which she also composed. With 15 albums released in Brazil as 2000, others were launched especially for the American market and dominated a period in which anxiety provoked a loss of voice; Marina Lima is one of the biggest divas of Brazilian rock.\n3) Marina Luchenko-Szczesna (Polish: Marina Łuczenko-Szczęsna; Ukrainian: Марина Лученко–Ще́нсний; born 3 July 1989), known mononymously as Marina (stylized as MaRina), is a Ukrainian-Polish singer-songwriter and actress.\n4) Marina Vénache, known as Marina on stage, is a French singer born on October 30, 1985. She started her career in the sixth season of the TV show \"Star Academy\" in 2006.\n5) Marina Marqueza (currently using the name Marqueza) is a non-binary Japanese-Venezuelan artist, singer, and producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah making genre-fluid music from the bottom of their heart. They want to see the Salt Lake City art scene become more radically inclusive of the diversity of talent that already exists, and they put that intentionality behind every event they agree or refuse to be a part of. Marina loves Existimos, Patty and Graciela, and she wants to perform a set that is affirming and healing from their place as a queer person of color. Her debut album, Orbit Pluto, was released on January 1, 2019.\n6) Marina, a Czech metalcore band from Prague.\n7) Marina Nakamura(中村 真里奈, Nakamura Marina, born February 7, 1987) is a Japanese singer and songwriter from Miyazaki who is signed to 5pb. Marina debuted in 2010 singing songs for the anime television series Angel Beats! as one of two vocalists for the fictional band Girls Dead Monster. In May 2013, she made her major solo debut with the release of her single \"Kimi Tsunagu\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marina\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Daft Punk was a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris, France, and separated in early 2021, consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. \n\nDaft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.\n\nThe group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).\n\n\nEarly years (1987–1993)\n\nThomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. \n\nStereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that \"The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it.\" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music \"a bunch of daft punk.\" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, \"We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly.\" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.\n\n\nHomework era (1993–1999)\n\nIn 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\".\n\nDaft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \"Da Funk\". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of \"Da Funk\", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.\n\n\"Da Funk\" and \"Alive\" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. \"Da Funk\" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was \"Around the World\", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.\n\nDaft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.\n\n\nDiscovery era (1999–2004)\n\nBy 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.\n\nIt reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single \"One More Time\" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.\n\n2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.\n\n\nHuman After All era (2004–present)\n\nStarting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was \"we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.\"\n\nA Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" and \"Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)\". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.\n\nOn 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.\n\nDaft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.\n\nFollowing the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.\n\n\nInfluences\n\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that \"It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.\"They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record \"put everything together\" in terms of genre.\n\nThe liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that \"In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too.\" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, \"before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people.\" The Daft Punk track \"Teachers\" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that \"Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions — the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today.\"\n\nRomanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single \"Windowlicker\", which was \"neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track\" according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, \"On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,\" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that \"we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.\"\n\n\nVisual components\n\nDaft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.\n\nTheir outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.\n\nIn their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, \"We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.\"\n\nDuring a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. \"But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower.\" When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated \"No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you.\" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.\n\nDuring the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.\n\nIt is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, \"The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.\"\n\n\nLive performances\n\nIn the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.\n\nIn the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, \"Everything was synched up — the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to.\" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.\n\nAt the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.\n\nDaft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a \"memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening\" and ThisisLondon declared it \"an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria\".\n\nDaft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was \"a robotic spectacular\", while Shoutmouth described the set as \"typically triumphant\". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.\n\nDaft Punk headlined the AT&T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance \"was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop.\" On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nDaft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nModular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.\n\nDaft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of \"Stronger\" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, Élodie Bouchez, also attended the event.\n\nFollowing the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\".\n\n\nDaft Punk in DJ Hero\nDaft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song \"Human After All\".\n\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.\n\nDaft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track \"Derezzed\" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for \"Derezzed\", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.\n\nIn 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called \"Drive\" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording \"Rollin' and Scratchin'\" and \"Da Funk\". The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.\n\nIn October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.\n\nDaft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case.\n\nIn May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: \"I played for hours and they’re gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever.\" He also said that the album would be released \"next spring\".\n\nIn an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated \"The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's eardrums\".\n\n\nhttp://www.daftpunk.com\nhttp://www.daftalive.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Michael Joseph Jackson  (August 29, 1958 Gary, Indiana—June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), was an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Dubbed the King of Pop, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was also known for his philanthropy, charitable fundraising, and lifestyle, residing in a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch and often becoming the focus of tabloid scrutiny. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. Through his group, solo, and family work, he became one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first (and currently only) dancer from the world of pop and rock 'n' roll. Jackson's other achievements include 39 Guinness World Records—including one for \"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\"—13 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Legend Award and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards, 16 World Music Awards and the estimated sale of up 750 million units worldwide. Winning countless awards for his humanitarian endeavors, the singer has been honored by two Presidents of the United States. He has also been named as the artist of \"the Decade\", \"Generation\", \"Century\", and \"Millennium\" and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. Jackson has also won hundreds of other awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey, and The Weeknd, among others.\n\nJackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2002 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as \"the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley\". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intensely negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. \n\nOver the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered a sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.\n\nIn the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.\n\nOn December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.michaeljackson.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Pink Floyd is an English rock band, formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic band, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in popular music history.\n\nPink Floyd was founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar and lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass and vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became their primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The band also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and continued to tour before quietly disbanding in 1995. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions.\n\nPink Floyd was one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with influencing genres such as progressive rock and ambient music. Four albums topped US or UK record charts; the songs \"See Emily Play\" (1967) and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979) were their only top 10 singles in either territory. The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall two of the best-selling albums of all time. \n\nPink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between ‘Tea Set’ and ‘The Pink Floyd Sound’, with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as “Louie, Louie”, but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and ‘spaced out’ solos.\n\nThe heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles \"Arnold Layne\" in March 1967 and “See Emily Play” in June 1967. “Arnold Layne” reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and “See Emily Play” reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.\n\nReleased in August 1967, the band’s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album’s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece \"Interstellar Overdrive\" to whimsical songs such as \"The Scarecrow\", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters’s home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as \"The Gnome\". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.\n\nAs the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett’s behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd’s playing and singing duties. With Barrett’s behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band’s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett’s increasingly difficult compositions, such as \"Have You Got It Yet?”, which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett’s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O’Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.\n\nMusically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band’s most experimental music is from this period, such as \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, “Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict”, which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and “Careful with That Axe, Eugene” (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters’s primal screams.\n\nWhilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake “Jugband Blues”, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett’s departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.\n\nPink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film’s music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, “Green Is the Colour” and “Cymbaline”, became fixtures in the band’s live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters’s cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as “The Nile Song”.\n\nThe next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason’s first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from “found” instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters’s pure folk “Grantchester Meadows”), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (“Sysyphus”), meandering folk guitar (“The Narrow Way”) and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd’s most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.\n\n1970’s Atom Heart Mother, the band’s first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band’s then-current vocalists (Roger Waters’s folk-rock “If”, David Gilmour’s bluesy “Fat Old Sun” and Rick Wright’s psychedelic “Summer ‘68”). Another lengthy piece, “Alan’s Psychedelic Breakfast”, was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band’s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as \"a load of rubbish\" and Waters as suitable for \"throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again.\" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as “Echoes” in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters’s jazzy “Biding My Time”).\n\nThis is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the “psychedelic” scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason’s writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band’s masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright’s light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry’s saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band’s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band’s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band’s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with “Echoes” from Meddle (although “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters’s influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright’s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994’s The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour’s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)”/\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)\" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.\n\nThe band’s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic “Echoes” taking up the second side of the LP. “Echoes” is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a “sonic poem”. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be “the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.” The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric “One of These Days”, a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason’s menacing one-line vocal (“One of these days, I’m going to cut you into little pieces”), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on “Fearless”, and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on “A Pillow of Winds”. The latter track is one of the Floyd’s very few acoustic love songs. Waters’s role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy “San Tropez” brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.\n\nObscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band’s first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as “sensational”, it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of “Free Four”, the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters’s ruminations on his father’s death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, “Wots…uh, the Deal” and “Childhood’s End”, also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. “Childhood’s End”, inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour’s last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (“Burning Bridges”, “The Gold It’s in the…” and “Stay” being the best respective examples for each).\n\nThe release of Pink Floyd’s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band’s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968’s “Point Me At The Sky” and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (“Money”). The album became the band’s first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album’s sound, exposing the band’s jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album’s texture. For example, straight rock songs such as “Money” and “Time” are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in “Breathe” and female vocal-laden song “The Great Gig in the Sky” (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental “On the Run” is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album’s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason’s kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as “Us and Them“‘s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in “Brain Damage”. The album’s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band’s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.\n\nWish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”, a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band’s past were brought together — atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar — in the suite’s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, “Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a Cigar”, harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”. The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour’s wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett’s eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.\n\nDuring this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd’s output. Wright’s influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters’s feelings about his father’s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music’s background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.\n\nBy January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band’s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd’s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which used “Pigs”, “Dogs” and “Sheep” as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums’ sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it “tedious” and “bleak”, although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London’s Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band’s live shows from then on.\n\n1979’s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. The Wall also included the future concert staples “Comfortably Numb” and “Run Like Hell”, with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group’s best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on “The Trial” and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as “Goodbye Blue Sky” and “Nobody Home”). Wright’s influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.\n\nDespite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.\n\nA film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, “When the Tigers Broke Free”, was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song “What Shall We Do Now?”, which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was “Hey You”, but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.\n\n1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters’s father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters’s anger at Britain’s participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (“The Fletcher Memorial Home”). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (“Two Suns in the Sunset”). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright’s departure, which had not been formally announced before the album’s release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP’s front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: “The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason”. Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music’s tone is largely similar to The Wall’s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like “Nobody Home” more than “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd’s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, “Not Now John”, the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour’s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.\n\nAfter The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour’s project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates’ projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.\n\nWaters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as “a spent force creatively”, but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name “Pink Floyd” should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as “Pink Floyd.” The suit was eventually settled out of court.\n\nAfter considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band’s dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.\n\nGilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright’s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.\n\nA year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O’Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O’Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.\n\n1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set’s packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words “The Big Bong Theory”.\n\nThe band’s next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour’s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album’s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, “Wearing the Inside Out”, Wright’s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore’s writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright’s subsequent solo album, Broken China.\n\nAt the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.\n\nThe band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.\n\nIn 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \"Marooned\".\n\nOn 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, \"I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd...\". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.\n\n1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.\n\nA live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980–1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as \"Echoes\", \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Marooned\", and \"High Hopes\" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.\n\nIn 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.\n\nTwo years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters — the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of \"Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)\", \"Money\", \"Wish You Were Here\", and \"Comfortably Numb\", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said \"thank you very much, good night\" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.\n\nIn the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.\n\nDavid Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Comfortably Numb\" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.\n\nMany fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on \"pretty amicable terms\". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.\n\nOn 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert \"that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts\". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his \"finished with Pink Floyd\" sentiment to \"who knows\".\n\n2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles \"Arnold Layne\", \"See Emily Play\" and \"Apples and Oranges\" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.\n\nOn 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of \"Arnold Layne\" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.\n\nHopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of \"Pink Floyd!\" to which he responded, \"Later.\" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of \"Roger Waters!\" to which Gilmour politely responded, \"Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.\"\n\nIn a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: “I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn’t even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.”\n\nOn 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that \"I can’t see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It’s very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn’t my joy.\"\n\nIn December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, \"Which One's Pink?,\" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either \"Ain't gonna happen\" or \"Anything could happen\". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he \"wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,\" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.\n\nIn a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: \"Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age –having achieved this– I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next.\" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.\n\nSpeaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion \"categorically\" won't happen. Gilmour said: \"The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.\"\n\nOn 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.\n\nIn April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.\n\nOn 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform \"Comfortably Numb\" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.\n\nOn 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb\n\nIn 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of \"The Wall\". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on \"Comfortably Numb\" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of \"Outside the Wall\"\n\nOn 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special \"Immersion\" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. \"The Endless River\". The record uses the 1994 ambient session known as \"The Big Spliff\" as its basis. The \"Big Spliff\" recording was expanded upon with material from recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record features material recorded by the late Rick Wright for the 1994 session, but does not include Roger Waters. \"The Endless River\" was released in November 2014.\n\nIn August 2015 David Gilmour announced that Pink Floyd had 'run its course' and was now officially disbanded. \n\nIn April 2022, following Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, Gilmour and Mason reunited as Pink Floyd and released a new single, titled \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" \n\nDiscography:\n-albums:\n\n1.

On December 4, 2020, Lacy released a compilation album titled The Lo-Fis.\n\n(2)  Steve Lacy (July 23, 1934 – June 4, 2004), born Steven Norman Lackritz in New York City, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer recognized as one of the important players of soprano saxophone. Coming to prominence in the 1950s as a progressive dixieland musician, Lacy went on to a long and prolific career. He worked extensively in experimental jazz and to a lesser extent in free improvisation, but Lacy's music was typically melodic and tightly-structured. Lacy also became a highly distinctive composer, with compositions often built out of little more than a single questioning phrase, repeated several times.\nAfter Lacy was diagnosed with cancer in August 2003, he continued playing and teaching until weeks before his death on June 4, 2004 at the age of 69. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Lacy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her debut studio album If I Could Make It Go Quiet was released through AWAL on April 30, 2021.\n\nGirl in Red has been cited as a queer icon by Paper, and a \"phenomenon\" who is \"one of the most astute and exciting singer-songwriters working in the world of guitar music\" by The New York Times. She was nominated for Best New Artist at the 2020 Norwegian Grammy Awards. In January 2021, her singles \"I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend\" (2017) and \"We Fell in Love in October\" (2018) were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Girl+In+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Two months later, Beach House issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled.\n\nVictoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song \"Waiting for the Ambulance\". Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release Veckatimest and she sings on \"Slow Life\", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.\n\nIn September of 2009 Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's Devotion, Teen Dream would be released in early 2010. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beach+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Coldplay is a British alternative rock and pop band formed in London in 1996. The band's singer/pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion, met at University College London and came together from 1996 to 1998. During these two years, the band changed names from Pectoralz to Starfish and, finally, to Coldplay. Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band. They recorded and released two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was their first release on a major record label, after signing to Parlophone.\n\nColdplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the song \"Yellow\" in 2000, followed in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won many awards, including NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, received mostly positive reviews, though some critics felt it was inferior to its predecessor. Their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), the best-selling album worldwide of 2008, was produced by Brian Eno and released to largely positive reviews, earning three Grammy Awards. In October 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 34 countries, was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011, and received moderately positive reviews. Their sixth album, Ghost Stories, released in 2014, received mixed reviews and topped several national album charts. The following year the band released their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top two in most major markets, but received generally mixed reviews. Four years later, in November 2019, they released their eighth album, Everyday Life, which received mainly positive reviews.  \n\nTheir most recent work and ninth studio album, Music of the Spheres, is a space-themed album adding to Coldplay's extensive experimental discography. As of September 24, three singles from the album have been released: Higher Power, My Universe, and Coloratura, the latter of which being a ten-minute long prog rock journey. The full album releases on October 15, 2021. Further speculation regarding Coldplay's future has led fans to believe that two more \"volumes\" following Music of the Spheres will be released, due to extensive merchandising, music videos, and public statements terming this album \"Volume 1\". However, it is unclear as to what these future volumes may shape out to be. \n\nChris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience). The band finally settled on the name \"Coldplay\" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.\n\nBy 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During a weekend in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the EP Safety. Most of the discs were given to record labels and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the single \"Brothers & Sisters\", which they had recorded over four days in February 1999.\n\nAfter completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed a five-album contract with Parlophone in early 1999. After making their first appearance at Glastonbury, the band went into the studio to record a second EP, titled The Blue Room. Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October, and the single \"Bigger Stronger\" received BBC Radio 1 airplay. The recording sessions for The Blue Room were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like U2 and R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs.\n\nColdplay have won numerous awards throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards, six MTV Video Music Awards, seven MTV Europe Music Awards and seven Grammy Awards from 29 nominations. They have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Three of their albums—Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head and X&Y—are among the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s. Coldplay have supported various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. They have also performed at charity projects, including Band Aid 20, Live 8, Global Citizen Festival, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, One Love Manchester, The Secret Policeman's Ball, Sport Relief and the UK Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nColdplay's musical style has generally been regarded as alternative rock, pop rock, post-Britpop, and pop. Chris Martin once proclaimed the band's music as \"limestone rock\" in comparison to \"hard rock\". The band's music has been called \"meditative\" and \"blue romantic\"; it \"[reflects] on their emotions\" and Martin \"endlessly examine his feelings\". Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post-Britpop bands. In the late 1990s, the EPs released by the band had characteristics of dream pop, setting them apart from later studio albums. The tone of the band's first studio album Parachutes, which saw them emerge as one of the most prominent modern bands in popular music, was described as melodic pop with \"distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion\" but also being \"exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive\". Their alternative rock style has been compared to bands like U2, Oasis, a-ha and Radiohead. The band acknowledges the Scottish rock band Travis as a major influence on their earlier material. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Sir Elton Hercules John CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 Billboard Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (1970–2000) he had at least one song in the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nHis tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium.\n\nRaised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including Lulu, and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969 his debut album, Empty Sky, was released. In 1970 a single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, Elton John, reached the top ten in the UK and the US, his first hit single. After decades of commercial chart success, John has also achieved success in musical theatre, both in the West End and on Broadway, composing the music for The Lion King (film and musical), Aida and Billy Elliot the Musical.\n\nHe has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards – winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013 for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him Number 49 on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, Billboard ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists (third overall behind the Beatles and Madonna). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Having been named a Commander of the British Empire in 1996, John was made a Knight Bachelor by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.\n\nHe has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over US$200 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005, and after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014, wed Furnish on 21 December 2014. On 24 January 2018, it was announced that John would be retiring from touring and would soon embark on a three-year farewell tour, which began in September 2018.\n\nElton John has written with his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin since 1967 when he answered an advertisement for talent placed in the popular UK music publication, New Musical Express, by Liberty records A&R man Ray Williams. The pair have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. The writing style that Elton John and Bernie Taupin use involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own, and John then putting them to music, with the two never in the same room during the process. Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then post them to John, wherever he was in the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and record.\n\nIn 1992, John was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. He is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA). His voice was once classed as tenor; it is now baritone. His piano playing is influenced by classical and gospel music. He used Paul Buckmaster to arrange the music on his studio albums during the 1970s.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1994. He and Bernie Taupin had previously been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992. John was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1995. For his charitable work, John was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 February 1998. In October 1975, John became the 1,662nd person to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHe was awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. He became a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor in 2004, and a Disney Legends Award in 2006. In 2000, he was named the MusiCares Person of the Year for his artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy. In 2010, he was awarded with the PRS for Music Heritage Award, which was erected on The Namaste Lounge Pub in Northwood, London, where John performed his first ever gig.\n\nMusic awards include the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" from The Lion King (award shared with Tim Rice); the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1994 for \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" from The Lion King (award shared with Tim Rice); and the Tony Award for Best Original Score in 2000 for Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida (award shared with Tim Rice). He has also received five Brit Awards, including the award for Best British Male in 1991, and awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1986 and 1995. In 2013, John received the first Brits Icon award in recognition of his \"lasting impact\" on UK culture, which was presented to him by his close friend Rod Stewart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Dua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English singer-songwriter. She was born in London of refugee parents from Kosovo, where she grew up part of her life, but saw everything change when as a child she moved back to her parents' homeland. While still in her teens, she returned to the British capital alone, inspired by her singer father to pursue an artistic life.\n\nDua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  \"Dua Lipa\" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. \"New Rules\"  and \"IDGAF\" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, USA and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries. The album also features the hits \"One Kiss\" with Calvin Harris and \"Scared To Be Lonely\" with Martin Garrix.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, \"Best Dance Recording\" for her song \"Electricity\" with Silk City, and moreover the \"Best New Artist\" award.\n\nBut Lipa's great success would even come in her second album \"Future Nostalgia\", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as \"Don't Start Now\", \"Break My Heart\" and \"Levitating\" , the album is currently the most played album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" and was present among the nominations for \"Album of the Year\". \"Don't Start Now\" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for \"Record of the Year\" at the Grammys.\n\nThe British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of \"Levitating\". The track became the only single by a female artist to go 33 weeks on the chart, being the only female act to achieve the feat. Months later, the same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 that she still doesn't have doesn't define success. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.\n\nHer newest hit with  Elton John and  PNAU, \"Cold Heart\" is on par to become one of the biggest hits of 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2018, he dropped out of college during his freshman year to pursue music full-time. Regarding this, he said:\n\nEverybody thought I was crazy, I knew what I was doing. Thank you everyone, this just the mf beginning!\n\nOn July 24, 2018, he released his debut mixtape titled 'NASARATI'.\n\nOn December 2, 2018, he released the hit “Old Town Road” which blew up through TikTok memes. It finally entered the Billboard Hot 100 in early March 2019. Old Town Road reached #1 on Spotify, iTunes and Apple Music as well as becoming the first song to simultaneously chart on the Billboard country and hip-hop/R&B charts before it was disqualified from the country charts. This caused lots of controversies. The track was eventually remixed featuring country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nOn April 3, 2019, it was revealed on Michael McCrudden’s popular YouTube show, “Before They Were Famous,” how Lil Nas X got his rap name. He said:\n\nIt was originally Lil Nas just to be ironic ‘cause every new rapper’s name has 'lil.’ Kinda got stuck with ‘lil’ after building a small fanbase.\nAdded the ‘X’ later on standing for the amount of years until I feel like I will be considered a legend.\n\nOn May 13, 2019, Billboard confirmed Lil Nas X signed with CAA for worldwide representation.\n\nOn June 21, 2019, Lil Nas released his debut EP, '7 EP'.\n\nIn January 2021, his hit song \"Old Town Road\" set a record as the highest certified song ever by the RIAA with 14-times platinum status in the United States, meaning it accumulated 14 million in equivalent song units.\n\nOn January 5th, 2021, Lil Nas X released a children's ABC picture book named 'C is For Country'.\n\nOn March 26, Lil Nas X released “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)”. Then, the day after he announced his 1st studio album, 'MONTERO' releasing that summer.\n\nOn July 23rd 2021, Lil Nas X released “INDUSTRY BABY (feat. Jack Harlow)”  featuring Jack Harlow.\n\nOn September 17 2021. Lil Nas X released 'MONTERO' . It consisted of 15 tracks including the 3 lead singles “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)”, \"“INDUSTRY BABY”, and \"SUN GOES DOWN\" and features from Doja Cat, Elton John, Jack Harlow, Megan Thee Stallion and Miley Cyrus. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Nas+X\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Malcolm McCormick, also known by his stage name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled \"But My Mackin' Ain't Easy\" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including \"K.I.D.S.\" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and \"Best Day Ever\" in 2011, which featured the hit single \"Donald Trump\". \n\nHe was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled \"Circles\" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller's family.\n\nIn 2013, Miller released his second studio album, \"Watching Movies With the Sound Off\". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler the Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend Schoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.\n\nIn 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape \"Faces\". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including Schoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. \n\nIn 2015, Mac released his third studio album, \"GO:OD AM\", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than \"Faces\" and \"Watching Movies With The Sound Off\", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.\n\nIn 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled \"The Divine Feminine\". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. \n\nIn August 2018, following major events in Miller's life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller's drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled \"Swimming\". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\n\nMiller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of \"Swimming\".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller's passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled \"Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life\", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, Schoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper's life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.\n\n In January 2020, Miller's posthumous album titled \"Circles\", worked on in companionship with his album \"Swimming\", was announced on January 8 along with the single \"Good News\" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac's artistic vision. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Queen is an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist and pianist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass guitarist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor.\n\nThe band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor's former band Smile split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. \n\nThere was much deliberation as to what the band's name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.\n\nUltimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie's. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was \"right\" for the band.\n\n\"Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It's just a name, but it's very regal, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. \"\n- Freddie Mercury.\n\nQueen went through several bass players before  a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. \n\n\"Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they'd look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn't play. - Brian May.\n\nThis quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right.\" - Brian May.\n\nLater that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down.  The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. \n\nIt was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of \"perfection\".\n\nQueen's self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, \"Queen II\" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album's single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band's mimed appearance on Top of the Pops. \n\nThe band's second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a \"concept album\", split into \"White Side\" vs. \"Black Side\". \n\nAs was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople.\n\nSheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band's rigorous touring schedule. \n\nSheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May's Now I'm Here and the song that would be the band's \"turning point\", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.\n\nDuring this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album \"A Night At The Opera\", featuring the epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\n\nQueen's popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their \"Live Aid\" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury's untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.\n\nOver the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films (\"Flash Gordon\" and \"Highlander\"), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.\n\nIn 1995, 4 years after Mercury's death, the band released the album \"Made In Heaven\". This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of \"I Was Born To Love You\" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song (\"Mother Love\"). \n\nQueen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.\n\n\nSeveral \"Queen + ...\" projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a \"Greatest Hits III\" album was released. This featured, among others, \"Queen + Wyclef Jean\" on a rap version of \"Another One Bites the Dust\", a live version of \"Somebody to Love\" performed by George Michael, and a live version of \"The Show Must Go On\" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.\n\nBrian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen's hits with guest vocalists, including \"We Will Rock You\" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk) and \"We Are the Champions\" (with Robbie Williams).\n\nOn the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical 'We Will Rock You'  opened in the Dominion theatre in London's 'West End'. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren't allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening.\n\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be 'featured with' Queen as 'Queen + Paul Rodgers', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.\n\nQueen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.\n\nSince 2012, Queen has been touring with Adam Lambert as the frontman. \n\nMore information about Queen + Paul Rodgers can be found on their last.fm page.\n\nOfficial website: www.queenonline.com\n\nDiscography:\n1.- Queen (1973)\n2.- Queen II (1974)\n3.- Sheer Heart Attack (1974)\n4.- A Night at the Opera (1975)\n5.- A Day at the Races (1976)\n6.- News of the World (1977)\n7.- Jazz (1978)\n8.- The Game (1980)\n9.- Flash Gordon (1980)\n10.- Hot Space (1982)\n11.- The Works (1984)\n12.- A Kind of Magic (1986)\n13.- The Miracle (1989)\n14.- Innuendo (1991)\n15.- Made in Heaven (1995) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Jackman Thomas \"Jack\" Harlow (born March 13, 1998), is an American rapper and songwriter. He is signed to Generation Now and Atlantic Records. He is also the co-founder of his own musical collective, Private Garden. He is best known for his single \"Whats Poppin\", which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHarlow was born and raised in Louisville. Harlow began rapping at age 12. He and a friend used a Guitar Hero microphone and a laptop to record rhymes and songs. They made a CD entitled Rippin' and Rappin' and sold copies at their school (Highland Middle School). When he was in seventh grade, Harlow acquired a professional microphone and made his first mixtape, Extra Credit, using the moniker \"Mr. Harlow\".\n\nHarlow attended Atherton High School, graduating in 2016. During his freshman year, his YouTube videos drew the attention of major labels, but he chose not to pursue any of the deals offered to him at the time. In November 2014 during his junior year, he released another mixtape, Finally Handsome.\n\nIn November 2015, Harlow released his first commercial album, an EP entitled The Handsome Harlow. It was released through Gill Holland's sonaBLAST! record label. Throughout high school, he often played sold out shows at Louisville venues like the Mercury Ballroom, Headliners, and the Haymarket Whiskey Bar. In early 2016, he released a single, \"Never Woulda Known\", which featured Johnny Spanish and was produced by Syk Sense. In March of that year, he opened for Vince Staples in Louisville.\n\nIn June 2016 less than a month after graduating high school, he released the mixtape, 18, which was the first album on his label and music collective, Private Garden. The collective also features Harlow's frequent collaborators, the Homies, composed of Louisville rappers and producers Ace Pro, 2forwOyNE, Shloob, Quiiso, and Ronnie Lucciano. Over the course of the next year, Harlow performed at South by Southwest, Bonnaroo, and the Forecastle Festival. He also spent time traveling back and forth between Louisville and Atlanta to work with engineer/mixer, KY Engineering. In March 2017, he released the song \"Hitchcock\", produced by 2forwOyNE and J-Reid.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, he released the single \"Routine\". In October of that year, he released another single, \"Dark Knight\", with an accompanying music video. He credits CyHi the Prynce with helping him work through his writer's block and finish the song. The song would become the lead single off Harlow's mixtape Gazebo, which was released in November 2017. He went on a 14-city Gazebo Tour in support of the album. The Homies opened for Harlow, and the tour ended in January 2018. In May 2018, Harlow opened for indie rock band, Portugal. The Man on select tour dates. The following month, he was featured alongside Lil James and Sixteen on the Skeme song \"Get Sumn\".\n\nIn August 2018, it was announced that Harlow had signed to DJ Drama and Don Cannon's Atlantic Records imprint, Generation Now. He also released a video for his single \"SUNDOWN\" on the day of the announcement. On August 17, Harlow released his major label debut mixtape, Loose. The album featured guest verses from CyHi the Prynce, K Camp, 2forwOyNE, and Taylor. In September 2018, he performed at the Genius IQ/BBQ event. In November 2018, Harlow embarked on a North American tour in support of Loose that is scheduled to end in late December. That month, he also released a music video for the song, \"PICKYOURPHONEUP\", featuring K Camp. On August 21, 2019, Harlow released the single \"Thru the Night\" featuring Bryson Tiller and launched his US tour, which started in October of the same year.\n\nIn January 2020, he released \"WHATS POPPIN\", with a music video from video director Cole Bennett, who had also directed videos for artists such as Juice Wrld, Lil Tecca, Lil Skies, and Blueface. The music video has surpassed one-hundred-fifty-five million views as of May 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Harlow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Mac DeMarco is the antithesis to your stereotypical singer-songwriter. Disregarding the seriously somber moments, he replaces them with whimsical and youthful spontaneity, whilst retaining endearing and subtle commentaries. Promptly after leaving his Edmonton garage for Vancouver he embarked on a grand voyage of enlightenment and alcoholic debauchery.\n\nDeMarco’s a weird cat, cultivating an affinity for occult imagery, nudity and social satire. But his most impressive trait is his undeniable and instinctual ability to compose magical pop jangles, which he refers to as “jizz jazz.” His dusted jams have garnished him accolades that are as ever-increasing as his song-writing abilities. Mac's favorite artists are Shuggie Otis, Steely Dan, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jonathan Richman and The Grateful Dead\n\nDeMarco was born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV on April 30, 1990, in Duncan, British Columbia. He was named after his great-grandfather, Vernor Smith (1864 - 1932), who was the Minister of Railways and Telephones in Edmonton. To spite his absentee father, DeMarco's mom Agnes changed his name to McBriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco when he was five. Friends and family came to know him as \"Mac.\" He grew up in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. After high school, DeMarco moved to Vancouver. Calling himself Makeout Videotape, Mac released his debut tape in 2009, entitled Heat Wave.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+DeMarco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1995), known professionally as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Characterized by his face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles and androgynous fashion, his music is often defined by dark subject matters and imagery built on a melodic emo approach to trap. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Uzi Vert gained initial recognition following the release of the commercial mixtape Luv Is Rage (2015), which led to a recording contract with Atlantic Records, to whom he signed to under DJ Drama's Generation Now imprint.\n\nLil Uzi Vert attracted mainstream attention following the release of his debut single \"Money Longer\" in 2016. The song would act as the lead single for the subsequent mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World (2016), which also contained the song \"You Was Right\". After releasing two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one in collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping Migos' single \"Bad and Boujee\". He later secured his first top ten single with \"XO Tour Llif3\", which won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of Summer.\n\n\"XO Tour Llif3\" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut studio album Luv Is Rage 2 (2017), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Lil Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist. His second studio album, Eternal Atake (2020), was among the most anticipated albums in hip hop and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\n2010–2015: Career beginnings\nWoods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical groups like Steaktown and in what he says was \"just for money\" under the name \"Sealab Vertical\". He later changed his name to Lil Uzi Vert from the way someone described his rap flow, saying his flow was \"Fast, like a machine gun.\"Woods' first project, an EP titled Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1 was released on January 19, 2014. The project, which was described as \"phonk\" and having cloud rap beats from The Guardian due to its psychedelic and \"trippy\" production features Woods with a bigger focus on lyricism than most of his career and was released with the single \"White Shit\" which included a video. The track, which was produced by Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop circles following Wood's entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the release of Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1, Woods caught the attention of then industry-mainstays like Mob.\n\nThe project and following features caught the attention of producer and Def Jam A&R Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of Woods' songs on a local radio station, who signed Woods to his The Academy imprint and produced his first mixtape, The Real Uzi which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release of The Real Uzi, Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.\n\nFollowing his signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured alongside Kid and Ferg on Carnage's single \"WDYW\". He also released several songs on SoundCloud including the Metro Boomin produced \"No Wait\", \"Pressure\" which is a collaboration with Durk and  ''Loaf\". He was featured on Fall Out Boy and Khalifa's \"Boys of Zummer\" tour in August 2015.[24] Woods released his second mixtape, Luv Is Rage on October 20, 2015. The project, which features production from then-bubbling producers such as Sonny Digital, TM88 and Maaly Raw with features from Billboard charting rappers such as Khalifa and Thug, was received positively and was featured on numerous music blogs such as Fader, XXL and Vibe. He was further called a \"breakout artist of 2015\" by HotNewHipHop.\n\n2016: Breakthrough\nIn January 2016, Vert appeared at an Mob show in New York City to honor the deceased rapper Yams. In February, he released the single, \"Money Longer\" on his SoundCloud following a radio debut on Shade 45. Controversy arose in March 2016 after a riot broke out at SXSW's final day during Woods set. On April 15, 2016, Vert released his third mixtape and first commercial mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World. The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart, making its Woods first entry on the chart. The project spent 55 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart, eventually being certified Gold. Woods and Kapri (born Octave) embarked on a joint tour in May 2016, titled the \"Parental Advisory\" tour.\n\nIn June 2016, Lil Uzi Vert appeared in XXL magazine as part of their 2016 Freshmen Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi performed a ‘freshman cypher’ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and Kodak Black. As of March 2021, this cypher has received over 180 million YouTube views, by far the most for the XXL channel. Riding the wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list gave him, Woods released the video for the single \"Money Longer\" which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the following week, his first entry on the chart, at number 92 on July 2, 2016. The song later peaked at number 54 and is currently certified two-times platinum in the United States. Woods second entry on the chart, Metro Boomin produced \"You Was Right\" debuted at 89 on July 30, 2016 and peaked at number 40.\n\nOn July 12, 2016, Woods announced his fourth mixtape, The Perfect LUV Tape, which was released on July 31, his 22nd birthday. The mixtape featured the singles \"Seven Million\", featuring Future, and \"Erase Your Social\", both of which failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The mixtape debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200 album chart and is certified Gold by the RIAA. In October 2016, Woods was announced to be an additional artist on Canadian singer the Weeknd's tour.\n\nWoods announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane which was released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Woods announced Luv Is Rage 2 which eventually went through a series of delays.\n\n2017: Luv Is Rage 2\nUzi featured on the hip-hop trio Migos' single \"Bad and Boujee\". The single was released on August 31, 2016, and is from the trio's second studio album, Culture (2017). In January 2017, around the time the album released, the single debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead or featured artist, and his highest charting single as both. On February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP Luv Is Rage 1.5 while on tour with the Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its \"nerdy\" nature with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Woods' affiliation with the \"emo-rapper\" label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song \"Luv Scars K.o 1600\" and references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track \"XO Tour Llif3\".\n\n\"XO Tour Llif3\"'s significant popularity on SoundCloud resulted in Woods playing it live on the European leg of the Weeknd's tour and the following week the song was added to streaming services and released as an official single. On April 4, 2017, \"Xo Tour Llif3\" debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number seven, becoming the rapper's highest charting song and biggest song, being certified six-times platinum as of August 2018.\n\nLuv Is Rage 2 was delayed again on April 2, 2017 with Woods blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't getting released \"any time soon\" and confirmed that \"XO Tour Llif3\" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi Carti's single \"​wokeuplikethis*\". It was released on April 7, 2017, and is from Carti's debut commercial mixtape, Playboi Carti (2017). The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.\n\n\"​wokeuplikethis*\" was eventually certified platinum and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside ASAP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo and Frank Ocean on A$AP rappers collective Mob's single \"RAF\". The single was released by surprise on May 15, 2017 and is from the collective's second studio album, Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy. In early August, hip-hop media personality DJ Akademiks claimed that Luv Is Rage 2 would release within 30 days. On August 24, 2017, Luv Is Rage 2 was announced for a surprise release at midnight and on August 25, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released his heavily delayed debut studio album, Luv Is Rage 2, which included top ten single, \"XO TOUR Llif3\" as the lead single.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 135,000 album-equivalent units and has since been certified platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, with two, \"The Way Life Goes\", featuring Oh Wonder, and \"Sauce It Up\" becoming singles. During British singer Ed Sheeran's set at the Video Music Awards, Woods and Sheeran performed a medley of \"XO Tour Llif3\" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, \"Shape Of You\".\n\nIn September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to Lil Uzi Vert vs The World possibly titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2 and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled 16*29. In October, a joint-tour with Playboi Carti called the \"16*29 tour\" was announcedfurther promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour was cancelled shortly thereafter due to Woods claiming he needed to \"focus\". In October 2017, Woods headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration, alongside the Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Woods was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single \"Wanted You\". The song was released on November 3, 2017, Nav's 28th birthday, and is from Nav's debut studio album, Reckless (2018).\n\nOn December 4, 2017, \"The Way Life Goes\" music video was released with a remix, featuring Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj. The song subsequently peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100. Woods performed on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show performing \"The Way Life Goes\" on February 6, 2018 Uzi was featured alongside Kanye West on Travis Scott's song, \"Watch\", which was released on May 3, 2018. \"Watch\" debuted at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He was also featured on a remix for fellow rapper Lil Tracy's single \"Like a Farmer\".\n\n2018–2020: Eternal Atake, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, and Pluto x Baby Pluto\n\nWoods in 2018\nIn January 2018, Uzi announced that he had completed a mixtape with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new Uzi project was dropping in 2018 and speculation arose in July 2018 when Woods tweeted the words \"Eternal Atake\", his second studio album (2020), pinning the tweet and announcing it was \"coming soon\" and then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for the project. The then-chosen cover art for Eternal Atake references the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.\n\nThe art was the source of a threat from the two remaining members of the organization over legal attack. The then-thought lead single from Eternal Atake, \"New Patek\" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, \"Multi Millionaire\". The single was released on October 5, 2018, and is from Pump's second studio album, Harvard Dropout.\n\nIn April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled \"Sanguine Paradise\" and \"That's a Rack\", originally thought to be from his highly anticipated studio album, Eternal Atake.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled, \"Futsal Shuffle 2020\", which is the lead single of Eternal Atake.[92] He then released the second single of the album, titled \"That Way\", on March 1, 2020. Eternal Atake was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. The release date of the album was a week earlier then fans expected it to release. \"New Patek\", \"That's a Rack\" and \"Sanguine Paradise\" did not appear on the album. Eternal Atake debuted atop the Billboard 200.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of Eternal Atake and the sequel to his July 2016 mixtape, Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World, titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2, would release the following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original album. The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy and Nav. The first half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position (equal to 288,000 album sales in the United States) with 400 million streams in early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the largest streaming count for any album since 2018 when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, Tha Carter V, got 433 million streams.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled \"Sasuke\", the first since the release of the deluxe version of Eternal Atake. On July 10, 2020, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's \"Party Girl\". On July 21, 2020, Lil Uzi and Future hinted at an upcoming joint project titled Pluto x Baby Pluto on their social media; it was released on November 13, 2020 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.\n\n2021–present: Subsequent ventures\nIn late 2020, Lil Uzi Vert began promoting new singles on Instagram live that were sonically similar to popular releases early in his career. He subsequently announced an upcoming project titled Forever Young, as well as a follow-up to Luv Is Rage 2 and a project to be released exclusively on SoundCloud. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+UZI+VERT\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Meat Is Murder went on to enter the British charts at number one in February of 1985, and The Queen Is Dead further confirmed the band's popularity with its release in spring 1986. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number two on the U.K. charts, the album also developed The Smiths' cult following in the U.S., breaking into the Top 100.\n\nAfter the band's split in 1987, a further six albums have been released, bringing the total number of Smiths albums to 13. These albums consisted of another five compilation albums (Best... I, ...Best II, Singles, The Very Best of the Smiths and The Sound of the Smiths), and one live album (Rank) recorded before the band's split during The Queen Is Dead tour. Both \"Best I\" and \"Best II\" were heavily criticised by critics and some fans; \"The Very Best of\", was very similar content to said \"Best\" albums, sold excellently, but drew much criticism from press and the band, who had no input.\n\nFormer members\n\nBass was originally played by Dale Hibbert, but he was replaced after 4 months. Craig Gannon was briefly a second guitarist for the band in 1986.\nSee The Smiths First Meetings <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Melissa Jefferson (born April 27, 1988 in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper and singer. She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.\n\nBorn in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).\n\nIn 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. \n\nThe success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” \n\nHer timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.\n\nLIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "There are at least six artists with this name:\n1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer\n2. An American instrumental group\n3. A Belgian indie rock band\n4. An American singer/songwriter\n5. A Dutch rock band\n6. An American math rock band\n7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.\n\n1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. Willow has released 4 studio albums; her debut, ARDIPITHECUS released in 2015, The 1st released in 2017, WILLOW released in 2019 and lately I feel EVERYTHING released in 2021. She is also part of THE ANXIETY, a collaborative project with Tyler Cole. The projects debut album, THE ANXIETY, was released in 2020.\n\n2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.\nKyle Coleman-Drums/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass/Keys/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin/Violin/Noise \n\n3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.\n\n4. Willow is a self-taught singer/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.\n\n5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.\nWillow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.\nThe Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.\n\n6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, \"Roanoke\" was issued in 2012.\n\n7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.\n \nRewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Willow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Panic! at the Disco is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie. It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.\n\nContinuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012.\n\nAs a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.\n\nIn 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released \"Say Amen (Saturday Night)\", the lead single from its sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked (2018), which was released in June. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Panic%21+at+the+Disco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "There are at least six groups named The Killers, the most known being an an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001.\n\n1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001. Their line-up is:\nBrandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), \nDave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), \nMark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals),\nRonnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). \n\nThey got the name from the fictional band The Killers in the video for New Order's song Crystal. \nAs of 2021, the band has released six studio albums, which have sold 28 million records worldwide. \n\nThe Early Years\nInitially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.\n\nHot Fuss\nThey released their debut album Hot Fuss on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was Somebody Told Me. The band also had chart success with their singles Mr. Brightside, which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and All These Things That I've Done.\n\nSam's Town\nThe band started recording its second album, Sam's Town, on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. \nThe first single, When You Were Young debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. \nThe video clip of the second single, Bones, was directed by Tim Burton. \nThe third single was Read My Mind. The video for it was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. \nThe last one was For Reasons Unknown, released in June, 2007.\nThe album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. \n\nSawdust Compilation\nThe compilation album Sawdust, containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. \nThe album's first single Tranquilize, a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division's song Shadowplay on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album contains songs Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (a The First Edition cover), Romeo and Juliet (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of Move Away (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf, the first but previously unreleased part of the so called Murder Trilogy, in which it is followed by Midnight Show then Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\n\n(Red) Christmas EP\nIn 2006 Songfacts reported that The Killers were recognized for their work with Bono's Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. \nIn the same year they have released their first Christmas themed song and music video, A Great Big Sled in aid of the charity, followed by Don't Shoot Me Santa on December 1, 2007. \nTheir festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and (Red) Christmas EP intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on November 29, 2011.\n\nDay & Age\nThe third album Day & Age was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). \nThe album's first single Human was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ's suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet.\nKillers frontman Brandon Flowers said (in December 2008) that he thinks that his band \"will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think\". He told The Daily Telegraph that \"U2 are unbelievable, but they're getting old. It feels like it's time\". \nThe album was reviewed at Silent Soundwaves.\n\nBattle Born\nThe band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reported that Runaways, the first single from the new album, was released on July 10, 2012. \nThe Killers' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released on 18 September 2012. \nIt took 15 months to record it. The band began working on it after they took a touring break for a little over a year. The album had five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, The Rising Tide. \nThe debut single was Runaways, followed by Miss Atomic Bomb and Here with Me.\n\nWonderful Wonderful\nIn 2015, Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning began to discuss recording a fifth studio album. The band recorded the album between September 2016 and May 2017, with production by Jacknife Lee. Band members Dave Keuning and  Mark Stoermer both announced that they would take a break from touring. The Killers' fifth studio album,  Wonderful Wonderful, was released on September 22, 2017, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200. Stoermer\n\nImploding the Mirage\nOn November 15, 2019, the Killers announced their sixth studio album titled Imploding the Mirage for a Spring 2020 release. On March 12, 2020, the album's lead single \"Caution\" was released, featuring a guitar solo by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Buckingham said of the band, \"There’s such a strong center to what they’re doing. Their material is so well crafted that it cuts across a lot of generational lines.\" Brandon Flowers also confirmed that guitarist Dave Keuning was still on hiatus and did not participate in recording the album. On April 25, 2020, \"Caution\" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, setting a record of 13 years and 6 months since the band's last number-one song on the chart.\n\nThe Killers' sixth studio album, \" Imploding the Mirage\" was released on August 21, 2020. It debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200.\n\nInfluences\nMuch of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen's music and lyrics.\n\nOfficial Site\n\n2.

        "content": "Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Frank Ocean. It was released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings.\n\nAfter releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording his debut album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. Other producers to work on the album included Om'Mas Keith and Pharrell Williams. Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator, vocalist/songwriter André 3000, and guitarist John Mayer.\n\nChannel Orange has an unconventional musical style, drawing on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, psychedelic music, and nonmusical sounds such as film dialogue and ambient noise that function as interludes. Vocally, Ocean uses a free-form flow as well as alternating falsetto and tenor registers throughout the album. His songwriting explores themes of unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme–color synesthesia, through which he perceived the color orange during the summer he first fell in love.\n\nTo prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean and Def Jam released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. It was promoted with five singles, including Ocean's highest charting single \"Thinkin Bout You\" (number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100) and a supporting concert tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week, eventually selling 621,000 copies in the US by September 2014. Critically, it was the best-reviewed album of 2012 and the year's top-ranked album in numerous critics' lists, including the American Pazz & Jop and the British HMV Poll of Polls. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Channel Orange was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Urban Contemporary Album. It has been featured in several lists of the best albums of the 2010s and of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/channel+ORANGE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\"The College Dropout\" is the debut studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\nA widespread critical success, \"The College Dropout\" was praised for West's production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music's balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. It earned the rapper several accolades including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been named by Time, Rolling Stone, and other publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn the years leading up to the album, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded The College Dropout over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.\n\nThe album's production was primarily handled by West and developed his \"chipmunk soul\" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch-shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; it also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.\n\nThe College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a massive commercial success, becoming West's best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014. The album was promoted with singles such as \"Through The Wire\", \"Jesus Walks\", \"All Falls Down\", and \"Slow Jamz\", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/The+College+Dropout\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's Starboy, following the release of the 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy. The album is dedicated to a fan, which passed away shortly before the album's release.\n\nThe standard edition has no featured artists, and the deluxe edition features remixed tracks, with guest appearances from Chromatics and Lil Uzi Vert, along with additional production from The Blaze, Johnny Jewel, and OPN. After Hours' deluxe edition was later updated to include three new bonus tracks. A remix EP titled After Hours (Remixes) featuring the deluxe edition's remixes and an additional remix was later released. After Hours will be promoted with the After Hours Tour, which is set to span North America and Europe.\n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Joker, Casino, and Uncut Gems, with the last film having a cameo appearance by The Weeknd himself. The two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles have supported the project: \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\", as well as \"In Your Eyes\". The album's title track has been issued as a promotional single.\n\nOn March 19, 2020, a record 1.02 million users pre-added After Hours to their Apple Music library. The album debuted atop the US Billboard 200, with 444,000 album-equivalent units, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album and marks the biggest first-week sales of 2020 for an album. It also reached number one in 16 other countries including Canada and the United Kingdom. The album received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best.\n\nBackground and release:\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd \"Chapter VI was coming soon.\" On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in My Dear Melancholy. Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album. Then after five months of silence, on November 24, the single \"Blinding Lights\" was revealed through a Mercedes-Benz television commercial, with reports of \"Heartless\" surfacing a day later. The latter song then premiered on the seventh episode of The Weeknd's Memento Mori Beats 1 radio show on November 27, 2019. \n\nWhich in the hours leading into the release of the radio show episode, The Weeknd announced on social media his return to music with the captions \"the fall starts tomorrow night\" and \"Tonight we start a new brain-melting psychotic chapter! Let's go!\" On February 13, 2020, The Weeknd revealed the title of the project \"After Hours\" through a 48-second teaser. A couple of days after the announcement of the album's name, its release date of March 20, 2020, was shared through social media to accompany the title track's release as a promotional single. In the last week leading up to the album's release, After Hours' tracklist was revealed on March 17, 2020. On March 19, 2020, The Weeknd announced that the album is dedicated to a long time fan and host of the popular XO Podcast, Lance, who died the night before. The album debuted alongside the eighth episode of Memento Mori on March 20, 2020, with The Weeknd also hosting a Spotify listening session upon its release. A deluxe edition of the album containing five remixes was released without any prior notice on March 23, 2020. On March 30, 2020, on the second anniversary of My Dear Melancholy, an updated version of the deluxe edition containing three new bonus tracks was released. A remix EP titled After Hours (Remixes) featuring the deluxe edition's remixes and an additional remix, was released on April 3, 2020.\n\nArtwork and aesthetic:\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Joker, Casino, and Uncut Gems, with the last film having a cameo appearance by The Weeknd himself. Tesfaye's physical appearance in the era has been described by journalists as being red-pigmented, with him consistently maintaining a red suit and specific hairstyles throughout all of the album's promotional material, such as its artwork, music videos, teasers, and live performances. \n\nThe Tammi brothers primarily handled the album’s overall art direction with its design being handled by Aleksi Tammi, and its photography and visual direction being handled by Anton Tammi, who directed the music videos for the album's singles, and the project's same-titled short film. The album's creative direction was handled by La Mar C. Taylor. Nabil Elderkin handled the photography and video direction for the promotional material of the deluxe version of the project, in this material, Tesfaye continues the era's \"Sin City\" theme, with him residing within a casino and donning a black suit in the two teasers for the bonus tracks. Notably, the black suit used in the teasers for the deluxe edition of the album and cover art for the bonus tracks and remix EP was the first time The Weeknd wore a non-red suit in the promotional material for the project since his first live performance of \"Blinding Lights\" on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (dated December 6, 2019), in which he donned a blue suit.\n\nOn February 20, 2020, The After Hours Tour was announced by The Weeknd through social media. It is set to span North America and Europe. The tour will last throughout the latter half of 2020, with it beginning on June 11 and ending on November 12. Sabrina Claudio, Don Toliver, and Black Atlass are set to open the tour.\n\nPerformances:\nOn December 5, 2019, The Weeknd performed \"Heartless\" for the first time on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. With \"Blinding Lights\" receiving its debut performance the following day on the same show. Both performances received positive reactions from critics and audiences and were compared to those done by Michael Jackson and Prince in the past. On January 22, 2020, \"Blinding Lights\" was performed at Jimmy Kimmel Live! Tesfaye's appearance during the performance on the show was inspired by the events that occurred within the aforementioned single's music video, which was released shortly before his live performance. The Weeknd was announced as a performer for the March 7, 2020 episode of the 45th season of Saturday Night Live. During his appearance, he performed a comedic track alongside Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd, made specifically for the show, titled \"On the Couch\", and the songs: \"Blinding Lights\" and the previously unreleased \"Scared to Live\", the latter of which featured electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and interpolates \"Your Song\" by Elton John.\n\nSingles\nOn November 27, 2019, the album's lead single, \"Heartless\", was released digitally on music stores and streaming services. American record producer Metro Boomin noticeably produced the song. At the time of its release, it was The Weeknd's first solo single since 2018's \"Call Out My Name\" from the EP My Dear Melancholy (2018). The single peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became The Weeknd's fourth song to top the chart, with it also becoming Metro Boomin's second chart-topper that he produced. Its music video was released on December 3, 2019.\n\n\"Blinding Lights\" was released digitally on music stores and streaming services on November 29, 2019, as the album's second single.

Its music video is set in the aftermath of \"Heartless\"' visual and was released on January 21, 2020.\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" was released to rhythmic contemporary radio on March 24, 2020, as the album's third single.

Journalists noted its resemblance to the digital work done in the 2019 film Uncut Gems, which Tesfaye had a cameo in. Its visuals were also compared to those found in the music videos for the album's first two singles.\n\nA self-titled short film for the album was first teased on March 3, 2020, with its release occurring on March 4, 2020. It was directed by Anton Tammi and continued the storyline and aesthetics found in the visuals for \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\". The film is set shortly after The Weeknd's performance of \"Blinding Lights\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (dated January 22, 2020) and features various snippets of the tracks from the album as Tesfaye navigates a subway. It concludes with The Weeknd seemingly murdering a couple in a secluded elevator. Journalists as being inspired by the films Joker and The Shining noted the visual.\n\nCritical reception\nProfessional ratings\nAggregate scores\nSource Rating\nAnyDecentMusic?    \n7.7/10\nMetacritic      83/100\nReview scores\nSource Rating\nAllMusic        4/5 stars\nConsequence of Sound  A–\nEvening Standard     \n3/5 stars\nExclaim!        8/10\nThe Guardian 4/5 stars\nThe Independent       \n4/5 stars\nNME  4/5 stars\nPitchfork       \n7.9/10\nPopMatters    8/10\nRolling Stone 3.5/5 stars\nAfter Hours was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 83, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? Gave it 7.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nWriting for Consequence of Sound, Candace McDuffie praised the album, stating, \"As he evolves, he continues to reinvent himself, and he knows exactly how to leave fans hooked on havoc. And After Hours is proof that he's not done with us yet; in fact, he's just getting started.\" Exclaim!'s reviewer Jacob Carey stated in his review that \"After Hours does feel like the Weeknd's very own version of Vegas – a place where overindulgence, self-loathing and promiscuity are not only welcomed but encouraged.\" The Guardian's critic Michael Cragg gave After Hours a positive review, praising the \"sense of narrative cohesion\" on the album, saying that \"songs bleed into each other, with sonic references dotted throughout to neaten up threads that previously he  would have left to unravel. \n\nBy balancing the two sides of his musical personality – not to mention add some levity to that boring, bad-taste id – After Hours feels like the first Weeknd album in a while to offer up a clear, singular vision rather than something frustratingly abstract.\" Writing for The Independent, Roisin O'Connor stated, \"After Hours abandons the danceability of its predecessor in favor of moody introspection. This is the music you listen to when the party's over.\" O'Connor further compares the album to The Weeknd's previous releases, saying that he on After Hours \"still delves into a bad boy persona but there's a tinge of remorse that runs through, in comparison to the cold and often cruel tone of earlier cuts.\" Luke Morgan Britton of NME called After Hours \"The Weeknd's strongest record in some time\" and that \"It's a record free of features and full of probing self-reflection.\"\n\nJon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, stating, \"After Hours certainly has its share of pity-partying. But there's also a vulnerability that goes beyond the usual too-beautiful-for-the-world sulking.\" Dolan also said that the album \"hits the best balance yet of the gloomy melodrama of the Weeknd's early EPs or his 2018 release My Dear Melancholy and the pop slickness of his 2016 LP Starboy.\" Writing for Variety, Jem Aswad praised the album, stating, \"The Weeknd is launching the next era with his most fully realized album yet, 'After Hours.' Sonically, the hallmarks are ultra-cinematic keyboards, pulsating sub-bass, hard beats (which are seldom danceable), '80s synthesizer flourishes and caverns of echo, all of which contrast with his high, angelic voice.\" Aswad ended his review by saying that \"After Hours is one of the most successful musicians of the past decade testing the balance between innovation and commerciality as much as anyone today.\" David Smyth of Evening Standard particularly praised the song \"Blinding Lights\", while stating that The Weeknd's \"in a bit of a fug\" on the rest of the album.\n\nCommercial performance\nDespite the album not being released yet during the tracking period ending on February 27, 2020, After Hours managed to reach a position of number 10 on the US Rolling Stone Top 200 through the 36,000 album-equivalent units provided by the already available singles at the time. On March 19, 2020, After Hours broke the record for the most global pre-adds for an album in Apple Music history, with over 1.02 million users pre-adding the album to their libraries.\n\nAfter Hours debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 444,000 album-equivalent units, including 275,000 pure album sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album and marks the biggest first-week sales of 2020 for an album. Additionally, after the album's first week of availability, all 14 songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100, with ten of them in the top 40, led by \"Blinding Lights\" at number one, and \"In Your Eyes\" debuting the highest, at number 16. The album remained at number one on the Billboard 200 in its second week with 138,000 album-equivalent units, of which 47,000 were pure album sales. It is The Weeknd's third consecutive album to spend multiple weeks.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with over 26,000 units sold, making it The Weeknd's second number one on the chart, five years after Beauty Behind the Madness. It also topped the chart in The Weeknd's native Canada, with 54,000 album-equivalent units. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd/After+Hours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen. The record, released on November 2, 1981, is the UK's all-time best-selling album. Combined with Greatest Hits II, it became the definitive Queen compilation. While a domestic release with different tracks but the same cover art was available in the U.S. in 1981, the British release was available to United States customers only by import until the 1995 release of Greatest Hits I & II, which combined the two discs. The seventeen-track UK Greatest Hits disc was released in the U.S. on its own for the first time, with a few bonus tracks, in 2004 under the name Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition.\n\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the Greatest Hits album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"Sweet Lady\" and \"Love of My Life\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' 1981 Hits release. In the UK and the U.S., where solid numbers could be collected, the standard was raised again by only including top twenty Hits.\n\nThe U.S. ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"Keep Yourself Alive\", which had been re-released in the U.S. in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Also, because of the delay in release dates between the UK (out first) and the U.S. (almost a month later), the U.S. was able to add \"Under Pressure\" (Queen's duet with David Bowie) to its Hits collection, as it was released during that interim.\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", and including \"Love of My Life\" (Live Killers version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nJumping ahead to 1991, Queen sought to issue a second Greatest Hits collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to Hollywood Records, who keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licencée). Hollywood Records decided to not release Greatest Hits II to the U.S. market, but instead created their own collection, Classic Queen (1992). This compilation was made up of tracks such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and \"Under Pressure\" (which had already appeared on the Elektra 1981 Hits collection) as well as newer tracks (\"A Kind of Magic\" and \"Radio Ga Ga\"). Some tracks were not even singles in the U.S. (\"One Year of Love\") or anywhere (\"Stone Cold Crazy\"). Though well received, this collection would eventually pose the problem of overlapping track lists in the future.\n\nHollywood Records, later that year, re-released a companion collection Greatest Hits with similar artwork (on a red background, where Classic Queen was on royal blue). Commonly referred to as the Red Greatest Hits, it features most of the '70s tracks absent from \"Classic Queen\" (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" , \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\").\n\nIn 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical \"We Will Rock You\", Hollywood Records released Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition which was the UK Greatest Hits with three bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the seventh studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John, released in 1973. It is regarded by many as his magnum opus. With worldwide sales of at least 31 million copies it is his best selling studio album. In 2000 Q magazine placed it at number 84 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 91 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nHistory\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road was recorded at the Château d'Hérouville, where John had previously recorded Honky Château and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. The amount of material was such that Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was released as a double album, his first. This album had originally been planned to be recorded in Jamaica, since The Rolling Stones had recorded Goats Head Soup there. Technical difficulties, coupled with political unrest in the country at the time, forced the band to make an early departure without any productive work done.\n\nIn addition to the three successful singles released from this album (see below), many other cuts received substantial airplay at AOR stations when the album was released, including \"Harmony\"; the 11-minute epic, \"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\"; and his Marilyn Monroe tribute, \"Candle in the Wind\".\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin\n\n\n Side one\n\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\" – 11:09 \n\"Candle in the Wind\" – 3:49 \n\"Bennie and the Jets\" – 5:23 \n\n Side two\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" – 3:13 \n\"This Song Has No Title\" – 2:23 \n\"Grey Seal\" – 4:00 \n\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\" – 3:38 \n\"I've Seen That Movie Too\" – 5:58 \n\n Side three\n\"Sweet Painted Lady\" – 3:54 \n\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)\" – 4:23 \n\"Dirty Little Girl\" – 5:01 \n\"All the Girls Love Alice\" – 5:09 \n\n Side four\n\"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock 'n Roll)\" – 2:42 \n\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" – 4:53 \n\"Roy Rogers\" – 4:08 \n\"Social Disease\" – 3:43 \n\"Harmony\" – 2:46 \n\n Bonus tracks (2003 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)\n\"Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)\" – 2:51 \n\"Jack Rabbit\" – 1:49 \n\"Screw You (Young Man's Blues)\" – 4:43 \n\"Candle in the Wind\"  – 3:51 \nThe original LP and CD issues were on two discs, while the 1995 CD remaster put the album on one disc as it was slightly less than 80 minutes. The 30th anniversary edition followed the original format, splitting the album across two discs to allow the inclusion of the bonus tracks, while a DVD on the making of the album was also included. The album has also been released by Mobile Fidelity as a single disc 24 karat gold CD.\n\nThe album was also released (2004) on a DVD-Audio in higher resolution.\n\n\nB-sides\nSong Format \n\"Jack Rabbit\" Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting 7\" (US/UK) \n\"Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)\" Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting 7\" (US/UK) \n\"Screw You (Young Man's Blues)\" Goodbye Yellow Brick Road 7\" (US/UK) \n\n\nPersonnel\n\"Funeral for a Friend\" \nElton John – piano \nDee Murray – bass \nDavey Johnstone – electric guitar \nNigel Olsson – drums \nDavid Hentschel – A.R.P. synthesizer \n\"Love Lies Bleeding\" \nElton John – vocals, piano \nDee Murray – bass, backing vocals \nDavey Johnstone – electric guitar, backing vocals \nNigel Olsson – drums, backing vocals \nDavid Hentschel – A.R.P. synthesizer \n\"Candle in the Wind\" \nElton John – vocals, piano \nDee Murray – bass, backing vocals \nDavey Johnstone – acoustic guitar, backing vocals \nNigel Olsson – drums, backing vocals \n\"Bennie and the Jets\" \nElton John – vocals, piano, organ \nDee Murray – bass \nDavey Johnstone – acoustic, electric guitars \nNigel Olsson – drums \n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" \nElton John – vocals, piano \nDee Murray – bass, backing vocals \nDavey Johnstone – Leslie guitar, backing vocals \nNigel Olsson – drums, backing vocals \nDel Newman – orchestral arrangement \n\"This Song Has No Title\" \nElton John – vocals, Farfisa organ, electric piano, mellotron, piano \n\"Grey Seal\" \nElton John – vocals, piano, mellotron, electric piano \nDee Murray – bass \nDavey Johnstone – electric guitar \nNigel Olsson – drums, congas \n\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\" \nElton John – vocals, organs \nDee Murray – bass \nDavey Johnstone – electric guitars \nNigel Olsson – drums \nPrince Rhino – vocal Interjections \nReggae Dwight (Elton John) and Toots Taupin (Bernie Taupin) -

        "content": "Dangerous Woman is the third studio album by American singer Ariana Grande and was released on May 20, 2016, by Republic Records. The album is the follow-up to her second studio album My Everything (2014), and features guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy Gray and Future. The album was originally titled Moonlight and had the song \"Focus\" as the intended lead single, however after finishing another track on the album she decided to change the album's name to Dangerous Woman and removed \"Focus\" from the album's tracklist, except in Japan, and the album's title track eventually replaced it as the lead single.  Dangerous Woman is primarily a pop and R&B album, with influences of house and dance-pop. Lyrically, the album is about love and destructive relationships and focuses on more mature content than her previous two albums, Yours Truly and My Everything. Grande served as an executive producer on the album, and worked with songwriters and producers such as Max Martin, Ilya and Tommy Brown to achieve her desired sound.\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, earning 175,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with 129,000 coming from pure sales. In the UK, the album debuted at the top slot, becoming her first number one in the country. It also reached the top 5 in 20 countries, including Canada, Japan, Belgium and Switzerland. The lead single \"Dangerous Woman\" was released on March 11, 2016. The second single, \"Into You\", was released on May 6, 2016. Two promotional singles were released for the album, \"Be Alright\" and \"Let Me Love You,\" featuring rapper Lil Wayne.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from critics. Most of them praised Grande's vocals and the mature lyrical content, separating her from her teen-star peers. However, a few criticized the album for containing too many different styles, stating that the Grande should settle for one sound. Grande has promoted the album multiple times on television. She hosted and was a guest performer on Saturday Night Live. She also sang a medley of \"Dangerous Woman\" and \"Into You\" at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/Dangerous+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The singer worked with a variety of producers on the album, including Tommy Brown, Anthony M. Jones, London on da Track, Murda Beatz, the Rascals, Scott Storch, Shea Taylor and Charles Anderson.\n\nGrande discusses themes of sex and romance on the album, which continues the R&B and trap-pop sound of its predecessors, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019). Positions also incorporates elements of hip hop, neo soul and funk, alongside guest appearances from Doja Cat, the Weeknd and Ty Dolla Sign. Upon release, the album was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics, most of whom complimented Grande's vocals but criticized the production and lyrics. Positions appeared in many year-end best music lists from publications.\n\nThe title track was released as the lead single a week before the album's launch. The song debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100 and earned Grande her fifth number-one single in the United States. It marked her third Hot 100 chart-topper in 2020, and made her the only act with five number-one debuts on the chart. Following the album's release, all 14 of its tracks charted simultaneously on the Hot 100, with the second single, \"34+35\", arriving at number eight. Positions debuted at number one on US Billboard 200 chart with 174,000 album-equivalent units, which includes 42,000 sales, marking Grande's fifth number-one album in the US. Elsewhere, it reached the top spot in Argentina, Canada, Ireland, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/Positions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Crash (stylised in all caps) is the fifth studio album by English singer-songwriter Charli XCX, released on March 18, 2022. It is her last album to be released under her current record contract with Atlantic Records. Charli announced the album title, release date, and artwork on November 4, 2021. Her website was also updated with information about the album's 2022 tour. The album was preceded by the four singles \"Good Ones\", \"New Shapes (feat. Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek)\", \"Beg for You (feat. Rina Sawayama)\", \"Baby\" and two promotional singles, \"Every Rule\" and \"Used to Know Me\". The sound consists of 80s, 90s & 00s inspired Synth-pop, Dance-pop & Power pop.\n\n\nWhen teasing and promoting the record since May 2021, Charli took on an evil, demonic or soulless persona, so as to play into a deal-with-the-devil idea. Visuals for the album include \"femme fatale powers\" and a multitude of \"dark spells and curses\" as well as signature nods to both cars and car crashes. Its title and overall aesthetic was inspired by David Cronenberg's 1996 movie Crash.\n\nOn May 23, 2021, she indicated that the album was \"for the True Romance angels\" and that she wanted to have a song that is \"Stay Away 2.0\". Then, on July 8, Charli posted that she was extremely into songs that she did not compose. During this month, Charli began to publish a lot of tweets and Instagram photographs indicating that the album would be her \"evil era\". One of them reads, \"Tip for young artists: sell your soul for money and fame\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/CRASH\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lipa began working on the album in early 2018, enlisting writers and producers such as Jeff Bhasker, Ian Kirkpatrick, Stuart Price, The Monsters and the Strangerz and others in order to create a pop record with a \"nostalgic\" and electronic feel.\n\nThree singles and one promotional single were released from the album. \"Don't Start Now\" was released as the album's lead single on November 1st, 2019. The song attained both critical and commercial success, becoming her seventh top 10 entry on the UK Singles Chart and second top 10 entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 2 on the latter. The album's title track was released as a promotional single on December 13th, 2019. \"Physical\" was released as the second single from the album on January 31st, 2020 and became her eighth top 10 single in the UK. \"Break My Heart\" was released as the third single on March 25th, 2020 and it samples the melody from \"Need You Tonight\" by INXS. In order to promote the album, Lipa announced the \"Future Nostalgia\" Tour, consisting of 24 shows in Europe and commencing in January 2021.\n\nMusically, \"Future Nostalgia\" has been described by Lipa as a \"dancercise class\". She stated that its songs will incorporate genres of disco and pop, inspired by artists such as Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Moloko, Blondie, and Outkast.\n\n\"Future Nostalgia\" was originally scheduled to be released April 3rd, 2020 and the tour to commence later in April. However, due to the spread of coronavirus, the European tour was postponed to January 2021, and the album was brought forward a week as Lipa wanted to spread happiness in such a dark time. Following her debut's complete edition, Lipa teased a future re-release of Future Nostalgia near the end of 2020, which will feature tracks that didn't originally make the record.\n\n\"Future Nostalgia\" has received a nomination for Album Of The Year, as well as Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2021 Grammys. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/Future+Nostalgia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After extensive promotional appearances and touring in North America and Oceania in support of their debut album, One Direction began recording the album in May 2012. As a follow-up to One Direction's internationally successful debut album Up All Night (2011), several writers and producers were enlisted, including Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Savan Kotecha, Ed Sheeran, Jake Gosling, and Tom Fletcher. The album is predominantly a pop music album, interpolating elements of pop rock, dance-pop, teen pop and power pop.\n\nThe album received generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics. Take Me Home topped the charts in more than thirty-five countries including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, sold over one million copies worldwide in its first week of release, and received a multitude of certifications across the globe. When Take Me Home topped the 1 million mark in US sales on the week ending 16 December 2012, One Direction became the first act to sell 1 million copies of two different albums in a calendar year since 2009. Their debut album Up All Night became the third best-selling album (1,616,000) and Take Me Home the fifth best-selling album (1,340,000) of 2012 in the United States, making the vocal quintet the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nThe lead single, \"Live While We're Young\", released on 28 September 2012, peaked inside the top ten in almost every country it charted and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-American artist. The album's second single, \"Little Things\", released on December 3, 2012, became the group's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. \"Kiss You\" will be released as the album's third single on 8 February 2013. Staged in support of the record, One Direction performed the album's songs on several television programs. The album's accompanying seven-month 2013 World Tour is scheduled to begin in February 2013. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/Take+Me+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on March 25, 2003. Following the collaboration album Reanimation which featured remixes of their debut album Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park released singles from Meteora for over a year, including \"Somewhere I Belong\", \"Faint\", \"Lying from You\", \"From the Inside\", \"Breaking the Habit\" and \"Numb\".\n\nIt is the most successful album in the history of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative rock songs. \"Numb\" was the biggest song of the year on the chart. The album has sold over 5 million copies in the United States, and over 16 million worldwide to date.\n\nThe album was named after the Meteora rock formation in Greece. After seeing these monasteries on a trip to Europe, the band was inspired by the way they were built, almost defying gravity. It was this feeling of greatness and awesome accomplishment that Linkin Park wished to convey with their music, thus the name.\n\nDon Gilmore co-produced the album. Linkin Park comprehensively rehearsed the album, recording more than 40 choruses for the first single \"Somewhere I Belong\". Like the band's first full-length Hybrid Theory, Meteora was recorded using multitrack recording methods in which each instrument is recorded individually rather than played all at once, as is done in a typical studio setting. In its first week it sold an estimated 810,000 units. To date, it has well over 4 million copies in the U.S. alone, nearly 16 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe music in Meteora represents significant changes since the release of Hybrid Theory. It is characterized by more relevant influences from rap metal (\"Lying from You\", \"Hit the Floor\", \"Faint\", \"Figure.09\", \"Nobody's Listening\"). Their instrumental song \"Session\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2003. \"Nobody's Listening\" featured a small sample from the band's track, \"High Voltage\", which appeared on the B-side of One Step Closer and the bonus disc of Hybrid Theory. The sample was a distorted version of Mike rapping, \"Coming at you from every side\" which comes from the chorus of High Voltage.\n\nThe instrumental track \"Session\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded and on the Season Five Sopranos episode \"In Camelot\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Meteora\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\"Abbey Road\" is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Although \"Let It Be\" was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, most of the album had been recorded before the \"Abbey Road\" sessions began. A two-sided hit single from the album, \"Something\" backed with \"Come Together\", released in October, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US.\n\n\"Abbey Road\" is a rock album that incorporates genres such as blues, pop, and progressive rock, and it makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band. John Lennon had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year.\n\nAlthough \"Abbey Road\" was an immediate commercial success and reached  No. 1 in the UK and US, it initially received mixed reviews, some critics describing its music as inauthentic and bemoaning the production's artificial effects. Over time, the album became viewed as among the Beatles' best and many critics have ranked it as one of the greatest albums of all time. In particular, George Harrison's contributions, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", are considered to be among the best songs he wrote for the group. The album's cover, which features the four band members walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, has become one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of popular music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road+(Remastered)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Goodbye & Good Riddance is Juice WRLD’s debut album, released on May 23, 2018 through his label, Interscope Records. It features 17 tracks and is available for streaming on SoundCloud, Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal.\n\nThe album is supported by five singles, “All Girls Are the Same,” “Lucid Dreams” and “Lean Wit Me\", \"Wasted\" with a feature from Lil Uzi Vert & \"Armed & Dangerous.\"\n\nGoodbye & Good Riddance explores Juice WRLD’s current relationship and the struggles he endures. The subject matter of the album varies throughout the tracklist, from discussion of past love interests in songs like “All Girls Are the Same” and “Lucid Dreams,” to details of his overpowering drug addiction in songs like “Lean Wit Me” and “Black & White.” The album also touches upon feelings of invincibility and delusion in songs like “Hurt Me,” where his frequent abuse of opioids and other drugs has driven him to recklessness.\n\nTwo of the album’s singles, “All Girls Are the Same” and “Lucid Dreams,” have found large success for Juice. Both songs have entered the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at 92 and 74 respectively, and amassing a combined 66 million streams on his SoundCloud. The success of “Lucid Dreams” is explained best by the Genius article “Chart Climber: Tracking The Rise Of Juice WRLD’s ‘Lucid Dreams’”:\n\n“Lucid Dreams” dropped on SoundCloud way back on July 1, 2017 as part of Juice WRLD’s JuiceWRLD 9 9 9 EP, but it wasn’t added to Genius until December 9. It received some attention thanks to burgeoning popularity on SoundCloud at the time, but didn’t gain significant traction until February 26, 2018, the day after the “All Girls Are the Same” video came out. That song’s explosive online success (to the tune of 14 million YouTube views and counting) was a rising tide that lifted all boats, and throughout March, “Lucid Dreams” averaged over 2,200 page views per day.\n\nWhen asked if he expected “All Girls Are The Same” to blow up in an interview with Pigeons & Planes, Juice responded:\n\n\"It was no different and I didn’t expect for it to do what it did. I wrote it. I usually freestyle but I wrote the first verse to that one and freestyled the second. I look at my music like, “I make this, I like this, it’s going to do what it does. Whatever that is.“\n\nOn July 13, 2018, the album was reissued on streaming services to include “Wasted,” which features Lil Uzi Vert, as the fifth song.\n\nThe album was reissued once more on Spotify and Tidal on December 10, 2018 to now include Juice’s single, “Armed and Dangerous,” as the fifth song. Additionally, the album’s skits were moved to the end of the album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Juice+WRLD/Goodbye+&+Good+Riddance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The reworked song is the original version which was leaked before the release, initially dubbed as \"Money Keep Coming In\" by fans. It was leaked through hackers who sold the song to fans through Discord. The song's release represents Uzi Vert's first song since his ongoing feud with his record label and since becoming a signee of Jay-Z's Roc Nation management firm. Initially being a single for Uzi's second studio album, it was revealed that it would be cut from the album with the reveal of the tracklist, which excluded Sanguine Paradise. \"Sanguine Paradise\" features a direct sample from Mykko Montana and K Camp's 2012 song, \"Do It\". The horn line and drums can be clearly heard, as well as a similar rhythm and tempo. The song before being reworked was noted as having \"the presence of some intense MIDI brass\" while the reworked version was described as \"opting for a more subdued variant.\"It is composed of \"light piano rhythms along with trumpet beats. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Uzi+Vert/Sanguine+Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\"Currents\" is the third studio album by Australian psychedelic rock act Tame Impala, released on 17 July 2015 on Interscope Records. Like the group's previous two albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and produced by primary member Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker also mixed the music. It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.\n\nAfter releasing the group's previous record, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on \"Currents\", largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and owing to his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project's prior work, \"Currents\" marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala's music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album's cover art depicting vortex shedding is a visualization of these themes.\n\n\"Currents\" was preceded by the singles Let It Happen, Cause I'm a Man, Disciples and Eventually. Like its predecessors, the album received critical acclaim. It became the group's best charting release, debuting at number one in Australia, number three in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, \"Currents\" was awarded \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Album of the Year\", among other honors that Tame Impala received. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Currents\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Blueprint is the legendary sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 11, 2001 on Roc-A-Fella Records in the United States. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West and Just Blaze. At the time of its recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop's most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss. In spite of its release coinciding with the 9/11 attacks, The Blueprint sold over 420,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Jay-Z's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It was certified double platinum as sales stand at over two million units in the U.S.\n\nThe Blueprint is a landmark release in Jay-Z's extensive catalog, and is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. Complex Magazine named it the top album of the 2000's and in 2019 The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It is also gave producer Kanye West his big break in the mainstream after years working in the Chicago underground scene.  West produced four of the album's 13 tracks, namely the lead single \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.),\" as well as the infamous Nas diss \"Takeover\" and the soulful favorite \"Heart of the City (Ain't No Love).\" 3 years later Kanye released his instant-classic debut album The College Dropout, which included a verse from Jay on the track \"Never Let Me Down.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/The+Blueprint\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Adele wrote “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)” in collaboration with Max Martin and Shellback for her third album 25.\n\nAdele played guitar on the record, and it was this riff that began the song. She told the New York Times:\n\nI’ve had that guitar bass line since I was, like, 15. I used to cover ‘Wonderful World’ doing that riff. It sings over it really well. With  Max Martin and Shellback, we knocked that out in a day.\n\nThis is a more upbeat, straight-pop record for Adele, which makes sense considering the super producers behind the sound. Prior to this record, however, Adele hadn’t heard of Max Martin or Shellback. It was listening to Taylor Swift with songwriter Ryan Tedder that led her to discover their prominence in the pop landscape.\n\nThis song was originally titled “We Ain’t Kids No More,” but at the last minute, at the encouragement of her manager, Adele decided to change it. She told Rolling Stone:\n\nOtherwise, you might as well just call the fucking album Old.\n\n(Given that a lot of the songs on this album are about nostalgia for childhood and the past.)\n\nThe song is directed toward the guy Adele dated between the subject of much of 21, and her husband, Simon Konecki. He previously inspired one other track, “One and Only”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/Send+My+Love+(To+Your+New+Lover)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the final installment in The Blueprint trilogy, preceded by The Blueprint (2001) and The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios and was handled by Kanye West, The Neptunes, Jeff Bhasker, Al Shux, Jermone Harmon, No I.D., The Inkredibles, Swizz Beatz, and Timbaland.\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 476,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with Elvis Presley, and produced five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, The Blueprint 3 received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Rolling Stone named it the fourth best album of 2009.\n\nBackground\n\nThe earliest hype over The Blueprint 3 came when DJ Clue released in January 2008 a mixtape song called \"Ain't I\", produced by Timbaland. In the intro, Clue says, \"Off that Blueprint 3 baby!\" However, a spokesperson for Jay-Z said that it was an old, unreleased song and that the recording of The Blueprint 3 had not yet started. On July 20, Timbaland, a frequent contributor to previous Jay-Z albums, told MTV News that he would be producing the whole album. But in an interview with the Rolling Stone magazine, Jay-Z called the statement \"premature\". In July 2009, Jay-Z confirmed The Blueprint 3 as the album's title during an interview with radio station Shade 45.\nBy November 2008, he had finished the album but with lengthy negotiations with Def Jam, he went onto reworking it. In January 2009, Jay-Z confirmed continued production of the album and admitted the leak of several songs. In a Billboard magazine interview, Jay-Z confirmed \"What We Talkin' About\", the album's intro, \"Thank You\", and \"Already Home\" as song names and collaborations with Australian dance group Empire of the Sun, rappers Drake and Kid Cudi and singer Rihanna. He also mentioned in an interview with DJ Semtex that his favorite song on the album is \"Empire State of Mind\". The official tracklist for Blueprint 3 was revealed on August 18, confirming the guest appearances from Drake, Alicia Keys, Rihanna, Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, J. Cole, and more.)\n\nReception\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 476,000 copies. It serves as the third-highest first-week sales of 2009.

It was the 5th Highest selling Rap Album of 2010 according to Billboard.\n\nCritical response\n\nThe Blueprint 3 received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 22 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau called the album \"fairly superb\" and gave it an A- rating, indicating \"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction\". Allmusic writer John Bush gave it four out of five stars and compared the album to its predecessors, describing it as \"somewhere between the two, closer to the vitality and energy of the original but not without the crossover bids and guest features of the latter (albeit much better this time)\". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the album succeeds at its goal of \"reaching maximum commercial blast radius while maintaining its street bona fides\". Steve Jones of USA Today praised Jay-Z's lyricism and wrote that he \"shows that for someone who is measured mostly against himself, lyrical dexterity doesn't have an expiration date\". The Daily Telegraph gave the album four out of five stars and complimented its modern sound. The A.V. Club gave it a B+ rating and stated \"Jay-Z sounds liberated by his legacy rather than weighed down by expectations\".\nHowever, Slant Magazine's William McBee found The Blueprint 3 \"predictable\" and \"complacent\", stating \"The album is a hip-hop feast, for sure, filled to the brim with elite production and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that it \"peters out in a mass of indistinct tracks\" following its first four songs. Andrew Martin of PopMatters gave it a five out of 10 rating and viewed its second half as weak, stating \"Jigga has the ability to push the envelope and make fantastic music. But on here, he has clearly reached an impasse of how to execute that perfectly\". Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen commented that it is \"so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated\". The Washington Post's Chris Richards gave the album a negative review and criticized its lyrical content, \"pairing bromidic couplets with swatches of keyboard piffle\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, critic Greg Kot gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars and viewed Jay-Z's celebrity and older age as somewhat of a flaw, stating:\nIt's tough for hip-hop stars to age well. Once they become celebrities living in mansions and starring in family movies, street cred is usually the first thing to go. Just ask Ice Cube. Longevity just wasn't built into the hip-hop lifestyle, with its premium on youthful swagger, street tales and fast turnover  'The Blueprint 3' aims to show everyone he still has wicked skills on the mike. It does, even as it illustrates that sometimes he coasts on his celebrity  The message: Don't mess with ol' Gray-Z.\nCharles Aaron of Spin criticized the album's production and commented that \"it's got its highs and lows\". Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen called it \"a catchy, pop-friendly record\", but viewed that it lacks the \"electric charge\" of Jay-Z's previous albums and that he is \"stuck for a subject  But he says it well\". Stephen Dalton of The Times gave the album three out of five stars and called it \"no great milestone, but far from the predicted disaster.\" Despite noting inconsistency in Jay-Z's rapping, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times complimented the album's varied musical elements and called it \"an unexpected blend of maturity and youth\". Pete Cashmore of NME gave it an eight out of 10 rating and wrote that it \"delivers because of hefty beats and quality rapsmanship, nothing else. And, ultimately, that’ll do just fine\". Kiilian Fox of The Observer commented that Jay-Z is \"maturing into a responsible elder statesman\". Zach Baron of The Village Voice viewed that \"much of Blueprint 3 is about the weird, meta-rap work of redefining what it is to be a boss\" and stated \"Jay-Z's midlife crisis is over. Which doesn't make The Blueprint 3 a classic. But we'll take it. For now\".\nThe Blueprint 3 was ranked the best album of the year by Billboard, and seventh best album of the year by MTV. Rolling Stone named it the fourth best album of 2009 in its year-end list.\n\n1.\t\"What We Talkin' About\" (featuring Luke Steele)\t(prod. Kanye West, No I.D.)\t4:04\n2.\t\"Thank You\"  \t(prod.

        "content": "The band entered Abbey Road Studios during the first week of 1975 to begin recording on their follow-up to Dark Side of the Moon. In the previous year, they introduced three new pieces to European audiences during the first sets of each show. Two of them, \"Raving and Drooling\" & \"You Gotta Be Crazy\", were ultimately not recorded for Wish You Were Here, but re-shaped and recorded in 1976 for the Animals album as respectively \"Sheep\" and \"Dogs\". \n\nThe third would take shape as the album's centerpiece, \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\". During tour rehearsals for the previous year's French summer tour, David Gilmour came up with the signature 4-note theme and the piece took shape from there. With the memory of former front-man/singer-songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett fresh in his mind, Roger Waters wrote the lyrics as a tribute to his fallen friend, at the time already an reclusive figure.\n\nIn 1974, it would be performed as one uninterrupted piece. However, during the band's tour of North America the following year, it would be split in two parts, sandwiching another new song, \"Have a Cigar\". A funky guitar-driven piece, it would ultimately be sung on the final recorded version by Roy Harper, as Roger's voice was in poor shape. This song, and the ominous \"Welcome to the Machine\" were written reflecting the band's negative attitude towards the record industry. They also (with various instrumental parts of \"Shine On\") feature synthesizers in a stronger fashion than previous albums, as well as the sound effects (provided by Nick Mason) that are signature to the Floyd sound.\n\nThe title track took shape when Gilmour came to the studio and showed the band the chord sequence, which suitably impressed Waters. He then wrote the lyrics, referring to Syd Barrett's departure and Roger's own growing alienation from his band and from other people (these themes later on would become essential to his story of The Wall). More than any previous Floyd number, it has a very prominent Country & Western feel to the instrumentation (pedal steel guitar and acoustic piano) and the melancholy feel to the lyrics. It would eventually become one of the band's signature songs, and is as of now (May of 2009) the band's most scrobbled song on Last.fm.\n\nTowards the end of the recording process, a stranger who at first looked unfamiliar to the band and the engineers appeared in the studio. After much discussion of who it was, the band slowly recognized him as the man whose story and personal relationship with the group had heavily influenced the record, Syd Barrett. Each member was unsure of what song they were mixing, but urban legend has it that it was \"Shine On\", which adds a new and deep personal resonance to the already emotional piece. Subsequently Syd disappeared from sight, as the band members attended David Gilmour's wedding ceremony that night. That was the last time any member of Pink Floyd had personal contact with their former enigmatic leader.\n\nThe record was released in the Fall of 1975, the band's first on Columbia Records (in the United States, EMI was and remained the Floyd's International label). It became the fastest selling record of their career, topping both the American (certified Gold within two days of it's release and ultimately 6X Multi-Platinum in May 1997 by the R.I.A.A.) and U.K. album charts (Gold within the year, but has yet to achieve Platinum status).\n\nThe band themselves hold the album in high artistic regard, despite the negative and disconnected environment during recording, with both Gilmour and Rick Wright saying it was their favorite. It was the last of their albums in which Rick played an important role in composing the music (making significant keyboard contributions on \"Shine On\"), until nearly 20 years later with The Division Bell. On the band's next three albums, the lions share of the song-writing credit would go to Roger Waters. This, in part with the deteriorating relationship between the band, would cause Roger to leave in 1985, ten years after Wish You Were Here.\n\nTracklist\n1.

        "content": "25 is the third studio album recorded by British singer and songwriter Adele. It was released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21, she had planned to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.\n\nPrior to the album's release, 25 was listed as one of the most anticipated albums of 2015. Billboard, Fuse, SMH and numerous others placed the album at number one on their list, with the latter stating \"if Adele releases her third album in 2015, she could dominate the year.\" Prior to the album's official announcement, music journalists and fans speculated that the album would be titled 25 continuing the age theme from Adele's previous releases 19 and 21.\n\nOn the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, \"Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year,\" was interpreted by outlets including the Billboard and Capital FM as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year.\n\nA release date for 25 was first suggested in early August 2014, when Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015. However, accounts filed by Adele's label XL Recordings in October 2014 ruled out the possibilities of a 2014 release. In August 2015, Billboard reported that Adele's label had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November 2015. In October 2015, the album was speculated to be released on 20 November 2015, after which numerous journalists speculated that other musicians had pushed back their albums in order to avoid chart competition with her, with artists such as Justin Bieber, Sam Smith and One Direction releasing their albums before Adele's, so that their sales and chart placements would not be affected.\n\nOn 18 October, a 30-second clip of \"Hello\" was shown on UK television during a commercial break on The X Factor. It teased a new song from Adele after three years, with viewers hearing her singing the first verse of \"Hello\" with its lyrics appearing on a black screen. It was seen by an estimated 13.4 million people. Three days later, Adele released a letter to her fans through social media addressing the album, in which she confirmed that the album would be titled 25.\n\nAdele stated that the title is a reflection on her age and the frame of mind she was in during that age, describing the time as a \"turning point\" where she was in the centre of adolescence and adulthood and the start of a time where she would \"go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk.\" Adele confirmed the next day 25 would be released on 20 November 2015 and revealed its cover simultaneously on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe lead single, \"Hello\", was released on 23 October 2015 and became a critical and commercial success, with the single becoming a worldwide number one hit in 16 countries.\n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for \"Album of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for her album \"25\", as well as \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\" for \"Hello\" from the same album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/25\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. In addition, it had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a woman. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the \"Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time.\"\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album, with Rolling in the Deep, Someone like You and Set Fire to the Rain becoming international number-one songs, while Rumour Has It charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, 21 is one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by veteran producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, the album was released by A&M Octone Records in September 2010 and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. The standard edition of the album includes three singles: \"Misery\", \"Give a Little More\" and \"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\"\nOn July 12, 2011, the band re-released the album to include their summer hit and the fourth single \"Moves like Jagger\".\n\nTo support the album, Maroon 5 embarked on concert tours including Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour (2010) and the Hands All Over Tour (2011), respectively.\nThe band began writing the songs from the third album, after winding down from a world tour in support of their second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long. Several months later, the band received a phone call from Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who had heard the band were beginning to write a new album, and expressed an interest in producing it. In a press release on their official website, the album is described as \"a killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk and R&B.\"\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, the band revealed they spent two months writing and recording their third album with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange in his recording studio in Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Lead singer Adam Levine, spoke about the experience of working with Lange: \"He worked me harder than anyone ever has,\"  \"I would come in with a finished song, and he'd say, 'That's a good start. Now strip it down to the drums and start over.' The coolest thing about him is that not only has he been a huge, legendary producer, but he also is a legit, serious writer.\"Rolling Stone has said that the resulting disc is the band's brightest-sounding and poppiest yet and that it delivers Lange's mix of catchy hooks and punchy rhythms. Levine has also said about the album: \"Our first record was a reflection of my love for Stevie Wonder. With the second I kept going back and forth between Prince and The Police. But there was no one on my mind for this album. It's just great pop.\" In a separate interview, however, Levine said that the album was influenced by Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye.The album artwork was revealed on July 1, 2010.The cover photo for the album was taken by 19-year-old photographer Rosie Hardy, who also serves as the model in the photo. Hardy took the photo herself in just under an hour, in her own bedroom from the town of Buxton, United Kingdom. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/Hands+All+Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on May 16, 2007, by A&M Octone Records, as the follow-up to their debut album, Songs About Jane (2002). The name was inspired by a phrase the band adopted to keep themselves motivated while on their tour.\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long has 12 songs, plus 6 bonus tracks. The band stated in interviews that the album has a different feel to it from their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane. The songs are not all based on one specific relationship, as in Jane, and also have a different sound than their first album, being more electric and drawing inspiration from such artists as Talking Heads, Michael Jackson and Prince. A review written prior to the album's release described the songs as having a very retro feel. Adam Levine explained that this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically: \"...you can dance to it, there's a little more attitude.\"\n\nAccording to Levine, working with other artists had influences on the album: \"Kanye West and Alicia Keys are amazing talents, in totally different ways. Just seeing such amazing people working in the studio. I definitely took things away from them.\"\n\nThe chorus of \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" is the same as the one used in the Kanye West single \"Heard 'Em Say\", which features Adam Levine, with exclusion to the line: \"...the distance between us makes it so hard to stay...\"\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 429,000 copies in its first week of release. It Won't Be Soon Before Long sold 102,000 copies digitally, breaking a record set last week when Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight (Machine Shop/Warner Bros.) moved 84,000 via that format to debut at No. 1. The latter album slips to No. 2 this week with 198,000, a 68% sales decline. In December 2007, the album ranked number one for iTunes top best selling albums of 2007.\n\nIn the UK, it became their second album to reach the number one spot, but their first to debut atop the UK Albums Chart. In Australia, peaked at number five, lower than their first studio album Songs About Jane which peaked at number one in 2004. It peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart and New Zealand. At number three in Ireland, Japan and Mexico, at number five in Australia and Taiwan, and number six in Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long was certified Gold in Ireland, Italy and New Zealand, platinum in Australia, Canada, Japan and the UK. 2x Platinum in the US, and 3x Platinum in South Korea. It was certified Diamond in Colombia and Mexico <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/It+Won%27t+Be+Soon+Before+Long\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

X condemns officers who abuse their authority and power, but he also condemns those who riot as a form of protest. He tells them that they should consider the people behind the businesses that they loot and destroy. He wants them to think about and realize how their spontaneous actions can have lasting repercussions for the victims and their families. He understands and agrees with their pain, but he wants them to channel it in a different, more peaceful way.\n\nThe song was initially released in mid-2015, months after the deaths of Michael Brown and more. After Brown’s murder, several riots occurred in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nA music video for “Riot” was included within the video for X’s December 2015 single, “Look at Me!” The video premiered on September 12, 2017. “Riot” was likely included because its message was still important after several more unjust killings of African Americans by police had occurred in the United States after its initial debut.\n\n“Riot” was re-released onto streaming platforms on June 1, 2020, notably amidst nationwide protests of George Floyd’s murder. One of the major aspects of these protests were violent riots and the looting of businesses across the country, so X’s message in this song was a foreshadowing of the then-current state of America.\n\nThe new version cuts the song to 1:19, removing the Klansman outro from the SoundCloud version of the track. It was released as simply “Riot” rather than the original all-caps from SoundCloud. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/XXXTENTACION/Riot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\"Discovery\" is the second studio album by the French house duo Daft Punk, released in March 2001. It marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house, which they were previously known for, to disco, post-disco and synthpop-inspired house. \n\n\nThe album provided itself as a soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which was a collaboration between the creators of the album, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei Animation. All of the music videos for the tracks on the album are segments of the film. Interstella 5555 follows a story of a kidnapped extraterrestrial band. \"Discovery\" is recognized as a concept album in reviews by New Musical Express and Spin magazines. Early versions of the album included a \"Daft Club\" membership card. The card included a code which granted access to an online music service, which featured tracks later released on the album of the same name and Alive 1997.\n\nTheme\n\nAccording to an interview with Remix Magazine Online, Thomas Bangalter stated:\n\nThis album has a lot to do with our childhood and the memories of the state we were in at that stage of our lives. It's about our personal relationship to that time. It's less of a tribute to the music from 1975 to 1985 as an era, and more about focusing on the time when we were zero to ten years old. When you're a child you don't judge or analyze music. You just like it because you like it. You're not concerned with whether it's cool or not. Sometimes you might relate to just one thing in a song, such as the guitar sound. This album takes a playful, fun, and colorful look at music. It's about the idea of looking at something with an open mind and not asking too many questions. It's about the true, simple, and honest relationship you have with music when you're open to your own feelings.\n\nLeiji Matsumoto supervised the creation of several music videos for \"Discovery\". The videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. It was created as a collaboration between Matsumoto, Daft Punk, Cédric Hervet and Toei Animation. The film features the entire album as its soundtrack. Regarding the album from the perspective of animation, Daft Punk stated that, \"We think the music we made on \"Discovery\" has been done in a cinematic way in our minds. We were visually seeing the music and trying to find ideas that were appealing to people's imagination. An animation fan would find this mixture of elements and story in our music.\"\n\nProduction\n\nA significant amount of sampling is present on the album. Rather than simply creating new music out of the samples, Daft Punk worked with them by writing and adding instrumental performance. The \"Discovery\" liner notes specify permitted use of samples for four tracks on the album: Part of George Duke's \"I Love You More\" is featured in \"Digital Love\"; Edwin Birdsong's \"Cola Bottle Baby\" was sampled for \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\"; The Imperials song \"Can You Imagine\" is used for \"Crescendolls\"; Barry Manilow's \"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\" is credited for \"Superheroes\".\nSeveral websites list many other samples present on the album, but Bangalter has stated that half of the samples listed are not true. He also stated the sampling they do is legitimately done, not something they try to hide. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on \"Discovery\"was played live by the duo:\n\n“I play more guitar usually, and Thomas plays more keyboards and bass. There's no ego involved. We don't argue about who's playing what. You can get the sound of a guitar with a keyboard, or the opposite. We don't really care about who's doing what as long as it's well-done. At the same time, when you use samples, you don't have this problem. When you use a sampler, nobody plays on it, so the problem of the ego of the musician is not really there. For everything that we do, no matter how you get to the results, the important thing is the result.”\n\nFeatured artists\n\nThe album features guest appearances by Romanthony, Todd Edwards and DJ Sneak. In regard to working with guest artists, de Homem-Christo stated:\n\n“We met Romanthony at the 1996 Winter Music Conference and became friends. Before that, we mentioned his name on “Teachers,” thanking him for his influences. We wanted to invite him to sing with us because he makes emotional music. What's odd is that Romanthony and Todd Edwards are not big in the United States at all. Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions, the compression, the sound of the kick drum, and Romanthony's voice... The emotion and soul is part of how we sound today. Because they mean something to us, it was much more important for us to work with them than with other big stars.”\n\nGiving his take on working with Romanthony and Edwards, Bangalter stated:\n\n“We wanted to work with Romanthony and Todd Edwards on our first album. They didn't know who we were at the time, so it was very difficult to convince them. When we met Romanthony in Miami, he told us he was very into what we were doing, which made us very happy. They are the house producers who were the biggest influence on us. Working with them was a way for us to close the circle. It was very important for us to do that, because they are part of what we do. Now that we've worked with them, we are free to explore other areas. It will be interesting to see what we'll do next. Now we can work with other people.”\n\nDJ Sneak also discussed working with Daft Punk on the album:\n\n“I went to Paris on one trip, got together with the boys and had a private party at the loft house where Thomas had just moved into  in a rare form of musical display we decided to make beats in front of a few guests. The next few days we continued to work on the music and I sat back and wrote the lyrics to \"Digital Love\". I had written other things but this song was very special from the get-go. I also co-produced the music and they polished it and finished a masterpiece.”\n\nReception\n\nUpon release, critics noted the immediate style differences of \"Discovery\" from Homework. The change in aesthetic was a jarring move for fans of Daft Punk's earlier work and initially caused some critics to pan the album. \"Discovery\" gained praise in later years; the album ranked #12 in Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of 2000–04 and #3 in their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s despite receiving an initial rating of 6.4. In 2009, Rhapsody ranked the album at #12 on its \"100 Best Albums of the Decade\" list. It was also named the 4th best album of the decade by Resident Advisor. Q rated the album five stars out of five, an unusual occurrence for the magazine. Regarding the album's structure, the magazine Spin noted that, \"It feels like a concept album -- in this case, the story of how wine-flow disco circumnavigated intellectual pretensions on all sides en route to a temporary utopia that may finally believe in nothing but the boogie but still has the infinite on its mind every minute.\" NME referred to \"Discovery\" as \"audaciously weird\" and added: \"With its famously camera-shy creators now dressing as funkadelic Power Rangers, it is also something of a concept album.\"\nThe album peaked at #2 in the United Kingdom and #44 in the United States. \"Discovery\" has sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005. The album was certified triple platinum in France (in 2007) for shipments denoting 600,000 copies. As a result of sales, \"Discovery\" was certified Gold by the RIAA as of October 11, 2010. Two cult hits were spawned from this album: \"One More Time\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". The song \"Face to Face\" (featuring Todd Edwards) reached #1 on the Billboard Club chart in 2004. The album was included on BBC Radio 1's Masterpieces in December 2009 presented by Zane Lowe, further highlighting the progression of the reception of the album and showing how highly regarded the album is amongst fans and fellow dance artists.\n\nSeveral songs from the album would later be sampled by other artists. Kanye West's song \"Stronger\" from the album \"Graduation\" features a vocal sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". \"Stronger\" was later performed live at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while Kanye West was on stage rapping. Wiley's song \"Summertime\" from the album See Clear Now features a sample of \"Aerodynamic\". Jazmine Sullivan's song \"Dream Big\" from the album Fearless features a sample of \"Veridis Quo\". On February 18, 2011, Trinity Orchestra played the first ever live full orchestral performance of \"Discovery\" at Trinity College. The filmed performance became the most watched YouTube video in Ireland on the day of its release.\n\nIt really is a very good album <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Discovery\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Britney is the self-titled third studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on November 5, 2001, by JIVE Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her earlier albums ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!...I Did It Again (2000), Spears began to embrace a more mature sound with her next studio effort. Its music incorporates genres of pop and dance-pop with influences of R&B and occasionally dips into elements of disco, hip hop and rock; its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality. Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album's development, co-writing five of its tracks.\n\nUpon its release, Britney received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented the progression from Spears's earlier works, but criticized her increasingly provocative image. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 745,000 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth record In the Zone (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour, which began in November 2001 and continued through July 2002. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.\n\nSix singles were released from the album, all of which proved less successful than those of Spears's prior records. Consequentially, Britney became her first record not to yield a US Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit. Its lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" peaked at number twenty-seven on the chart, while follow-up singles \"Overprotected\", \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\", \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Anticipating\", and \"Boys\" reached the lower end of the chart and its extension, the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Britney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is named after a section of Frick Park (known as \"Blue Slide Park\") in Pittsburgh, near where Miller lived. Much of the production was handled by ID Labs, and the album has no guest appearances.\n\nDespite \"Blue Slide Park\" receiving mixed reviews from critics, it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 144,000 sales, making it the first independently-distributed debut album to top the chart since 1995.\n\nOn July 5, 2011, Mac Miller announced \"Blue Slide Park\" on his YouTube channel. The tracks \"Smile Back\" and \"Blue Slide Park\" were released as non-singles on September 23 and October 13, respectively.

At the time, it was Miller's highest charting single, surpassing \"Donald Trump\", which charted at number 75.\n\nThe second single, \"Party on Fifth Ave.\", also produced by ID Labs, was released on October 28, 2011, with an accompanying music video. The song debuted at number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\"Up All Night\" was released as the third single digitally via iTunes on November 15, 2011.

        "content": "\"Melophobia\" is the third studio album by American rock band Cage the Elephant. Recorded at St. Charles in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Jay Joyce, the album was released on October 8, 2013, through RCA Records. It is also the final album that features lead guitarist Lincoln Parish.\n\nFor \"Melophobia\", Cage the Elephant attempted to distance themselves from comparisons of the sound that influenced them, shutting themselves off from as much recorded music as possible. Melophobia means \"fear of music;\" the band did not view the term literally, but rather thought of the term as \"a fear of creating music to project premeditated images of self, like catering to cool, or making music to project an image of being intellectual or artistic or poetic, rather than just trying to be an honest communicator.\"\n\nFrontman Matthew Shultz viewed the record as a battle \"to remain transparent and to remain honest.\" Isaac Brock (frontman of Modest Mouse) once told his friend Tiger Merritt (of Morning Teleportation) that \"if you're not slightly embarrassed to sing the lyrics, you're probably not writing a good song,\" and encouraged him to refrain from attempting to write poetically but rather naturally. Shultz said this made sense to him. When writing new tracks, Shultz would often doodle an image alongside his lyrics for visual reference.\n\nThe album debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 albums chart on its first week of release, with around 18,000 copies sold in the United States. It also debuted at No. 6 on both the Top Rock Albums and the Alternative Albums charts. As of October 2015, the album has sold 174,000 copies in the US. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cage+the+Elephant/Melophobia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is a 1972 concept album by English rock musician David Bowie. It peaked at number five in the United Kingdom and number 75 in the United States on the Billboard Music Charts. A concert film of the same name directed by D.A. Pennebaker was released in 1973.\n\nUpon its release on 6 June 1972, Ziggy Stardust reached number five in the UK and number seventy-five in the US. The album was eventually certified platinum and gold in the UK and US respectively. The only single from the record, \"Starman\", charted at number ten in the UK while peaking at the sixty-fifth spot in the US.\n\nIn 1997, Ziggy Stardust was named the 20th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 24 and Virgin All-time Top 1000 Albums ranked it at number 11, while in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 48. It was named the 35th best album ever made by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q placed it at number 25 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2004 it was placed at number 81 in Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In his 1995 book, \"The Alternative Music Almanac,\" Alan Cross placed the album in the #3 spot on the list of '10 Classic Alternative Albums'. In 2006, the album was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.\n\nIn 2005, Seu Jorge did a cover album of 14 Bowie songs, many of them from Ziggy Stardust, as a soundtrack for the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou called The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions. The translation into Portuguese is not always exact, as Seu Jorge maintains the melodies and styles, but often varies the lyrics. Musician Saul Williams named his 2007, Trent Reznor produced album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, clearly in a nod to Bowies album.\n\nBowie claimed that the name came from a tailor's shop in London called Ziggy's. Bowie later told Rolling Stone it was \"one of the few Christian names I could find beginning with the letter 'Z'.\" \"Stardust\" comes from one of Bowie's labelmates, a country singer named Norman Carl Odam, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Bowie covered a Legendary Stardust Cowboy song, \"I Took a Trip (On a Gemini Spaceship)\" thirty years later on Heathen.\n\nThe Ziggy Stardust sessions began just a few weeks after Hunky Dory was released. The first song recorded for the album, the cover \"It Ain't Easy,\" was recorded in September 1971. The first session in November produced \"Hang on to Yourself,\" \"Ziggy Stardust,\" \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" (later shortened to \"Star\"), \"Moonage Daydream,\" \"Soul Love,\" \"Lady Stardust,\" and \"Five Years.\"\n\nAlso recorded during the November Ziggy Sessions were two more cover songs intended for the as-yet untitled album. They were Chuck Berry's \"Around and Around\" (re-titled \"Round and Round\") and Jacques Brel's \"Amsterdam\" (re-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\"). A re-recording of \"Holy Holy\" (first recorded in 1970 and released as a single, to poor sales, in January 1971) was initially slated for Ziggy, but was dropped in favour of \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.\" \"Round and Round\" was replaced by \"Starman\" and \"It Ain't Easy\" replaced \"Amsterdam\" on the album's final running order. All three were eventually released as b-sides.\n\n\"Velvet Goldmine,\" first recorded during the Hunky Dory sessions, was also intended for Ziggy, but was replaced by \"Suffragette City.\" RCA released it in 1975 as the b-side to the UK re-release of \"Space Oddity\" after having it remixed and mastered without Bowie's approval.\n\nAfter recording some of the new songs for Sounds of the 70s with Bob Harris (which appear on Bowie at the Beeb) as the newly-dubbed Spiders from Mars in January-February 1972, the band returned to Trident. They recorded \"Starman,\" \"Suffragette City,\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" by the end of the month.\n\n\"Starman,\" released as a single in April (and not intended for the final album at first), has never appeared in its original \"loud\" mix on CD. It differs somewhat in that it \"features a subdued 'morse code' section between the verse and the chorus\" compared to the original released in 1972. \"Starman\"'s b-side, \"Suffragette City,\" was mastered for the album with a three-note coda leading in from \"Ziggy Stardust\" to make the songs sound linked. They were never played as such by Bowie in concert.\n\nRecorded and released during the ensuing Ziggy tour were two other songs. The first, \"John, I'm Only Dancing,\" was recorded at Trident in late June and released (in the UK only) in September. \"The Jean Genie,\" recorded at RCA Studios in New York in early October at the start of the American tour, was released in the U.S. in November. The song was remixed for Aladdin Sane.\n\nRock keyboardist Rick Wakeman was given the opportunity to play keyboards on the album but Rick opted to join the progressive rock group Yes instead.\n\nThe album was intended by Bowie to serve as the soundtrack and musical basis for a stage show and/or television production telling the story of Ziggy Stardust. As well as the songs on the album, Bowie also intended songs such as \"All the Young Dudes\", \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll With Me\" (the latter two later recorded for Diamond Dogs) for this realization of the Ziggy story. In a Rolling Stone interview with William S. Burroughs, Bowie outlined the full plot of the Ziggy Stardust story:\n\n\"The time is five years to go before the end of the earth. It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock-and-roll band and the kids no longer want rock-and-roll. There's no electricity to play it. Ziggy's adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, 'cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news. 'All the young dudes' is a song about this news. It's no hymn to the youth as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\n\nThe end comes when the infinites arrive. They really are a black hole, but I've made them people because it would be very hard to explain a black hole on stage.\n\nZiggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a Starman, so he writes 'Starman', which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately...The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in Greenwich Village. They don't have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black hole jumping. Their whole life is travelling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles Brando, another one is a Black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie, the Infinite Fox...Now Ziggy starts to believe in all this himself and thinks himself a prophet of the future starmen. He takes himself up to the incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his disciples. When the infinites arrive, they take bits of Ziggy to make them real because in their original state they are anti-matter and cannot exist in our world. And they tear him to pieces on stage during the song 'Rock 'n' roll suicide'. As soon as Ziggy dies on stage the infinites take his elements and make themselves visible.\"\n\nThe more generally acknowledged story, however, has Ziggy Stardust himself being the \"starman\", from Mars, who has come to save the Earth with messages of love and peace, and Bowie has referred to Ziggy as a \"Martian\" in several interviews.\n\nSimple two-syllable phrases provide the spine for \"Suffragette City\" (\"hey man\"), \"Hang on to Yourself\" (\"come on\"), \"Lady Stardust\" (\"all right\"), and \"Five Years\" (\"five years\").\n\n\"Starman,\" the album's single, has been described as a cross between mod and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n1.

        "content": "Random Access Memories is the fourth and final studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It was released by Daft Life under exclusive license to Columbia Records on May 17, 2013 in Australia, May 20, 2013 in the United Kingdom and on May 21, 2013 in the United States. Work started on the record concurrently with the Tron: Legacy score, without a clear plan as to what its structure would be. Shortly after Daft Punk signed with Columbia, a gradual promotional rollout began for the album including billboards, television advertising and a web series.\n\nRandom Access Memories pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has generally been positive.\n\nThis production won Grammy's Album of the Year in 2013, Record for the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Get Lucky\", Best Dance/Electro Album & Best Engineered Album (non-classical). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Random+Access+Memories\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to the All Music Guide, “In its purest form, Rock & Roll has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody.  Early rock & roll drew from a variety of sources, primarily blues, R&B, and country, but also gospel, traditional pop, jazz, and folk. All of these influences combined in a simple, blues-based song structure that was fast, danceable, and catchy.” Rock usually has a prominent vocal melody, accompanied by guitar, drums, and bass. Many styles of rock music also use keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, mellotron, and synthesizers. Other instruments sometimes utilized in rock include saxophone (originally in the 50s the central instrument), harmonica, violin, flute, French horn, banjo, melodica, and timpani. Also, less common stringed instruments such as mandolin and sitar are used. Rock music usually has a strong back beat, and often revolves around the guitar, either solid electric, hollow electric, or acoustic.\n\nIn the late 1960s, rock music was blended with folk music to create folk rock, blues to create blues-rock and with jazz, to create jazz-rock fusion, and without a time signature to create psychedelic rock. In the 1970s, rock incorporated influences from soul, funk, and latin music. Also in the 1970s, rock developed a number of subgenres, such as soft rock, heavy metal, hard rock, progressive rock, and punk rock. Rock subgenres that emerged in the 1980s included synthpop, hardcore punk and alternative rock. In the 1990s, rock subgenres included grunge, Britpop, indie rock, and nu metal.\n\nA group of musicians specializing in rock music is called a rock band or rock group. Many rock groups consist of a guitarist, lead singer, bass guitarist, and drummer, forming a quartet. Some groups omit one or more of these roles and/or utilize a lead singer who plays an instrument while singing, forming a trio or duo; others include additional musicians such as one or two rhythm guitarists and/or a keyboardist. More rarely, groups also utilize stringed instruments such as violins or cellos, and/or horns like saxophones, trumpets or trombones. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Many different varieties of country music have arisen over the years, from the slick production of the Nashville sound to the rougher edges of outlaw country. There have been several cycles from periods of experimentation and fusion with other genres giving way to returns to traditionalism and back again. Recently, there has been a great deal of crossover between country and pop, beginning with Shania Twain in the mid-1990s and continuing through to Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. On the other hand, there is also a loosely-defined group of alt-country artists operating outside the mainstream of country and incorporating influences from other genres ranging from folk to punk. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/country\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff.  Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass.\n\nDubstep rhythms are usually syncopated, and often shuffled or incorporating tuplets. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138-142 beats per minute, with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar.  In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from 2-step drum patterns.\n\nOne characteristic of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble bass, where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically. This style of bass is typically produced by using a low frequency oscillator to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesizer such as volume, distortion or filter cutoff. The resulting sound is a timbre that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume, filter cutoff, or distortion. This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep, particularly at the more club-friendly end of the spectrum. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dubstep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Grunge is a subgenre of rock music that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American state of Washington, almost entirely in the Seattle area. \"Grunge\" was initially used to describe only the emerging music scene in Seattle; an unkempt collective of bands each with their own scuzzy take on 70s rock that was a reaction against the technicality and pretension of contemporary and dominant metal. Inspired by hardcore punk, metal (particularly 70s heavy metal like Sabbath and Led Zep and the overdriven proto-punk of the Stooges), and indie/ early alt. rock, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics.\n\nThe word grunge is believed to be  back-formation from the US slang adjective grungy, which originated in about 1965 as a slang term for \"dirty\" or \"filthy\". Mark Arm, the vocalist for the Seattle band Green River—and later Mudhoney—is generally credited as being the first to use the term grunge to describe this sort of music. Arm first used the term in 1981, when he wrote a letter under his given name Mark McLaughlin to the Seattle zine, Desperate Times, criticizing his band Mr. Epp and the Calculations as \"Pure grunge! Pure noise! Pure shit!\" Clark Humphrey, editor of Desperate Times, cites this as the earliest use of the term to refer to a Seattle band, and mentions that Bruce Pavitt of Sub Pop popularized the term as a musical label in 1987–88, using it on several occasions to describe Green River. Arm used grunge as a descriptive term rather than a genre term, but it eventually came to describe the punk/metal hybrid sound of the Seattle music scene.\n\nThe early grunge movement coalesced around Seattle independent record label Sub Pop in the late 1980s. The main pioneer bands who developed grunge were Green River, Malfunkshun, The Melvins, and Soundgarden. Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time. However, many grunge bands were uncomfortable with this popularity. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to impact modern rock music.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as \"the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest,\" appeared \"unusually tortured by success\" and struggled with an addiction to heroin. Rumors surfaced in early 1994 that Cobain suffered a drug overdose and that Nirvana was breaking up. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound; Nirvana summarily disbanded. That same year Pearl Jam canceled its summer tour in protest of what it charged as ticket vendor Ticketmaster's unfair business practices. Pearl Jam then began a boycott of the company; however, Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented the band from playing shows in the United States for the next three years. In 1996 Alice in Chains gave their final performances with their ailing estranged lead singer, Layne Staley, who subsequently died from overdosing on speedballs (heroin cocaine mix) in 2002. That same year Soundgarden and Screaming Trees released their final studio albums, Down on the Upside and Dust, respectively. Soundgarden broke up the following year.\n\nSome grunge bands have continued recording and touring with more limited success, including, most significantly, Pearl Jam. While in 2005 Rolling Stone writer Brian Hiatt described Pearl Jam as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame,\" he noted the band developed a loyal concert following akin to that of the Grateful Dead. Despite Nirvana's demise, the band has continued to be successful posthumously. Due to the high sales for Kurt Cobain's Journals and the band's best-of compilation Nirvana upon their release in 2003, The New York Times argued Nirvana \"are having more success now than at any point since Mr. Cobain's suicide in 1994.\"\n\n\"In any case, by 1992 grunge was at the peak of its popularity and the group’s trademark sound in no way resembled that of commercially successful acts such as Soundgarden or Pearl Jam (though, ironically, King’s X were partly responsible for inspiring grunge; Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament once said, “King’s X invented grunge”).\"\n\nFor more information, see here <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Grunge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It may sample music from other sources such as rock and roll, have frequent use of guitars or other live instruments, or incorporate blues or jazz. \n\nOriginating in the late-80s, in midst of the Golden age of hip hop, alternative hip hop was headed primarily by East Coast groups such as De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, and Digable Planets in subsidiary conjunction by West Coast acts such as The Pharcyde, Digital Underground, and Jurassic 5 as well as certain Southern acts such as Goodie Mob and OutKast. Similar to the alternative rock movement, alternative hip hop initially began to segue into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. The classic debut albums 3 Feet High and Rising, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, and Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as managing to be both ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip hop music as a whole.\n\nHowever, a resurgence came about in the late 1990s-early 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public. Arrested Development, along with The Fugees, stand as the some of the first few alternative rap groups to be recognized by mainstream audiences.[1] Rodrick cites Arrested Development, Basehead, and The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy as examples of such \"alternative\" hip-hop.[10] Since the mid 90's, indie labels such as Rawkus Records, Rhymesayers, Stones Throw and Definitive Jux have experienced lesser mainstream success with alternative rap acts such as MF DOOM, Atmosphere, Black Star, Pharoahe Monch, and Aesop Rock. It was in the 2000s that alternative hip hop finally secured a place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as OutKast, Kanye West, and Gnarls Barkley.[11] Not only did OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below receive universal acclaim from music critics and manage to appeal listeners of all ages spanning numerous musical genres–including rap, rock, R&B, punk, jazz, indie, country, pop, electronica and gospel–but also spawned two number-one hit singles and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the RIAA for shipping more than 11 million units, becoming the best selling rap album of all time.[12] Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's Curtis as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so.[13] Although he designed it as a melancholic pop rather than rap, Kanye's following 808s & Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music.[14][15] During the release of The Blueprint 3, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that next studio album would be a an experimental effort, stating, \"... it's not gonna be a #1 album. That's where I'm at right now. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made.\"[16] Jay-Z elaborated that like Kanye, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip-hop.[17] The alternative hip hop movement is not limited solely to the United States, as genre-defying rappers such as Somalian poet K'naan, Japanese rapper Shing02, and especially Sri Lankan artist M.I.A. have achieved considerable worldwide recognition. In 2009, TIME magazine placed M.I.A in the Time 100 list of \"World's Most Influential people\" for having \"global influence across many genres.\"[18][19] Today, due in part to the increasing use of music distribution through the internet, many alternative rap artists are able to find acceptance by far-reaching audiences. Several burgeoning artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake have managed to attain record-breaking, chart-topping hit songs, \"Day 'n' Night\" and \"Successful\" respectively, which they both released on free online mixtapes without the help of a major record label. The pair, along with other new artists such as Wale, Asher Roth, The Cool Kids, and B.o.B, openly acknowledge being directly influenced by their '90s alt-rap predecessors in addition to alt-rock groups while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, life experiences and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip hop. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative+rap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Popular artists include Usher, Aaliyah, R. Kelly, Whitney Houston, TLC, Seal, Jodeci, Mariah Carey SWV, Janet Jackson, En Vogue, Brandy, Boyz II Men, and Monica.\nTeen pop carries over from the late 1980s into the year 1990, with New Kids on the Block at their peak and Debbie Gibson and Tiffany at the end of their careers. In 1997 teen pop comes back in a much larger way than it ever was in the 1980s with hit-factory groups including the Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls that overshadowed not only the acts of the 1980s like them, but all other music popular in the late 1990s. \nA revival of the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s, closely connected to Third-wave feminism and the Lilith Fair, this movement lasted up to about 2002 with artists like Norah Jones. Important artists include Alanis Morissette, Edwin McCain, Jewel, Natalie Merchant and Sheryl Crow.\nUnsure pop was a brand of pop that also had R&B and Grunge mixed in. It started in 1993 with bands like Completely Uncomplete, Unamazing Grace, & Great Hiding Place. It became popular in about 1996 when CCMZ & Evil Laugh formed. It ended in 2002 when CCMZ first disbanded.\n\nRock\n--------\nThe rise of the alternative rock sound and the fall of classic rock - 1990s rock was defined by lyrics relating to depression and awareness, and lacked both party songs and complex guitar solos.\nHair metal popular up to the year 1992, when Grunge took its place and Guns N Roses disbanded. The glory days of hair metal ended by 1990, from that point on, it was widely ridiculed and people waited for something new to take its place.\nGrunge, the defining genre of the decade, was popular from 1991 to 1994.

In both these ways glam informed the aesthetics and attitude of many punk/new wave bands who were to emerge a few years later.\n\nLargely a British phenomenon, glam rock peaked during the early 1970s.

This term was once used to differentiate between bands that were on a major record label and those that weren't. It also differentiates between an 'independent' sound and type of music and the more typical top-40 sound that was so prevalent during the 1980s. For example, many of the hair bands and hard rock scene had become very typical in musical composition (melody, chorus, melody, bridge, chorus, etc.). 'Indie' music may or may not follow this pattern.\n\nFor these reasons, in recent years the term 'indie' has been applied to bands that have rock sound but aren't on a major record label. Bands like Coldplay, The Killers and Razorlight are not classified as being 'indie' because of this. On the other hand, bands such as Radiohead (who are no longer on a major record label), Pavement, Belle And Sebastian, and Joy Division can be classed as indie using the \"independent sound\" meaning.\n\nThis term is wildly disputed on last.fm as well as on plenty of forums. People tag everything from Katy Perry to Meat Puppets as being 'indie'. You may even find some of your trve kvlt black metal bands appearing with an indie tag. As long as they aren't on a major record label.

Many lo-fi artists use inexpensive cassette tape recorders for their music. The term was coined by WFMU DJ William Berger who dedicated a half hour segment of his program to home record music throughout the late '80s under the name Lo-fi....\n\nAs a term to describe a musical genre, lo-fi is mainly associated with recordings from the 1980s onwards, when cassette technology such as Tascam's four-track Portastudio became widely available. Prime early exponents included Daniel Johnston, New Zealand bands such as the Tall Dwarfs, who recorded on Chris Knox's 4-track and released on Flying Nun Records, and Beat Happening and the Olympia, Washington label K Records. In the early-mid 1990s, Lo-fi found a wider audience with the success of such acts as The Apples in Stereo, Beck, Sebadoh, Guided By Voices, Pavement, Liz Phair, Will Oldham, Smog, Yo La Tengo, David Kilgour (musician) and (later) Elliott Smith.\n\nOften lo-fi artists will record on old or poor recording equipment, ostensibly out of financial necessity but also due to the unique aural association such technologies have with \"authenticity\", an association created in listeners by exposure to years of demo, bootleg, and field recordings, as well as to older pop studio recordings produced more simply. The growth in lo-fi coincided with the growth of extreme slickness and polish associated with the multitrack pop recording techniques of the 1980s.\n\nMany artists associated with the lo-fi movement, such as Bill Callahan, or Bob Log III, have frequently rejected the use of finer recording equipment, trying to keep their sound raw instead, whereas others such as Guided by Voices and The Mountain Goats slowly moved to using professional studios.\n\nMany new acts are bringing lo-fi production back in to use. These bands are often grouped under the genre \"noise pop\", these bands include No Age, Wavves, Crystal Stilts, Titus Andronicus and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart.\n\nThe black metal genre embraced the lo-fi idea during the late 1980s and early 1990s as it strived to distance itself from pop music. Most bands recorded their albums on extremely low budgets, using four-track recorders and any other equipment they could use. The greatest example is the Darkthrone album Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nEarly Industrial music was typically lo fi by nature. To create a raw 'industrial' sound.\nAnti-Folk is also a notable genre to use lo fi.\n\nThe 2010s gave rise to a scene within the house genre where artists created recordings with lo-fi aesthetics, imitating the sound of late-80s and early-90s house music and adding contemporary styles. Notable artists include Mall Grab, Florian Kupfer, Ross From Friends and DJ Seinfeld. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Lo-Fi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Derrick May described it as sounding like George Clinton (of Parliament and Funkadelic) and Kraftwerk stuck in an elevator. Atkins' early tracks were akin to the emerging electro of Hashim, Herbie Hancock and Man Parrish, and also shared an emphasis on drums found in the freestyle of Freeez, Shannon and Paul Hardcastle combined with the deep bass and danceability of British new wave synthpop (eg. New Order, Simple Minds, Pete Shelley) and the spacey sound of italo disco (eg. Rizo Ortolani, Laser, Charlie).  There was also a lot of crosspollination between Detroit techno artists and Chicago house artists particularly noticeable in Saunderson's work with Inner City.  Chicago acid house by Steve \"Silk\" Hurley and Lil' Louis sounds particularly close to techno.  In 1988, Atkins, May and Saunderson released  a compilation album, 'Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit.'\n\nThe word or prefix 'techno' had been used by or about the Techno Twins (1977), Kraftwerk (1978 in Japan's 'Rock Magazine'), Yellow Magic Orchestra (1979 single Technopolis), but Detroit Techno had a darker sound with more bass, and was often played at a faster more 'danceable' tempo.  Skinny Puppy is another early band that had been described as 'techno' (e.g. in Billboard 1985), but they were perhaps closer to the ebm of Front 242.   In the early 1980's, the Sheffield band Cabaret Voltaire went electronic, and moved into a funkier direction, and came to be classified as techno.  In Saunderson's Reese band, he was influenced by and influenced Belgian new beat (eg. A Split Second, 101).\n\nWhen British bands such as The KLF and Psychic TV were formed in the mid-1980's, they took 'techno' in a psychedelic direction, and along with acid house, it began to be played at rave parties, impromptu dance events held in abandoned warehouses or outdoors.  Techno-influenced west European bands began to score major hits in the late 1980's early 1990's (eg. Snap!, Technotronic, 2 Unlimited) and came to dominate club music for a time.   In 1990, The KLF released \"What time is love? Live at Trancentral\" sparking a spate of releases with crowd noise.  In 1991, Second Phase released \"Mentasm\" leading to the increasing use of the Hoover sound effect in rave/techno releases.   Breakbeat, chillout, hardcore, trance and trip hop developed within the techno rave scene, and eventually split off as separate genres.  The popularity of techno faded somewhat after 2000 (supplanted to some extent by house and trance), but minimal techno continues to be produced.  Gabber and happy hardcore developed out of hardcore techno.  Big beat bands such as The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, The Prodigy are also commonly classified as techno.  Rave techno is still an influence on electro house artists such as Benny Benassi, Bingo Players, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Global Deejays, Krewella and Vitalic.\n\nThis style of music uses loop-sequencing and turntables. Though often strongly mixing melodies and heavy bass lines, techno music relies on pulsing rhythms. Techno songs rely on heavy syncopation. Most songs are in 4/4 time and feature time marked with bass drums on the quarter note and hi-hats every second eighth note. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/techno\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Post-rock compositions often make use of repetition of musical motifs and subtle changes with an extremely wide range of dynamics. In some respects, this is similar to the music of Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, pioneers of minimalism. \n\nTypically, post-rock pieces are lengthy and instrumental, containing repetitive build-ups of timbre, dynamics and texture. When vocals are included the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where \"clean\", easily-interpretable vocals are important for poetic and lyrical meaning. When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in irregular intervals.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Chicago was the home base for a variety of post-rock associated performers. Both John McEntire of Tortoise and Jim O'Rourke of Brise-Glace and Gastr del Sol were important producers for many of the groups. One of the most eminent post-rock locales is Montreal, where Godspeed You! Black Emperor and similar groups, including Silver Mt. Zion, Do Make Say Think, and Fly Pan Am record on Constellation Records, a notable post-rock record label.\n\nSigur Rós, with the release of Ágætis byrjun in 1999, has become among the most well known post-rock bands of the 2000s. Explosions in the Sky, This Will Destroy You, Russian Circles, and Mono are some of the more popular post-rock bands of the 2000s.[30] With a few exceptions, most notably Sigur Rós and Mogwai, the post-rock of the 21st century has generally eliminated vocals from its repertoire. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz. Avant-jazz often sounds very similar to free jazz, but differs in that, despite its distinct departure from traditional harmony, it has a predetermined structure over which improvisation may take place. This structure may be composed note for note in advance, partially or even completely.\nHistory:\n1950s\nThe origins of avant-garde jazz are in the innovations of the immediate acolytes of Charlie Parker. Based in New York City, now-canonical musicians such as Charles Mingus, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane introduced modal improvisation and experimented with atonality and dissonance. Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, and Ornette Coleman became a new vanguard of controversial jazz innovators, outside the range of what many fans considered listenable.\n\n1960s\nJohn Coltrane's increasingly experimental work, and the Impulse! label became the flagbearers of the avant-garde jazz scene. Musicians associated with this high-volume variety of avant-garde jazz (sometimes referred to as \"fire music)\" included Archie Shepp, Albert Ayler, McCoy Tyner, Don Cherry, Pharaoh Sanders and Coltrane's wife, Alice Coltrane. Some of these musicians also began to take on an oppositional relationship to the mainstream music industry, preferring to release records themselves through independent labels such as ESP-Disk. This wing of avant-garde jazz was taken as emblematic of the Black Power movement, and also sometimes had mystical intentions.\n\nMusicians who incorporated the innovations of free and avant-garde jazz, but remained within a more conventional framework, recorded for Blue Note Records. Miles Davis's second quintet (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams), as well as others such as Eric Dolphy and Andrew Hill, are the best-remembered representatives of this style.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians began pursuing their own variety of avant-garde jazz, sometimes described as \"postmodern\" jazz. The AACM musicians (Muhal Richard Abrams, Anthony Braxton, Roscoe Mitchell, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago) tended towards eclecticism, and incorporated developments in 20th century classical music (particularly Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage) as well as funk and ska, in addition to Dixieland and other elements of jazz history. Rahsaan Roland Kirk also made use of pastiche.\n\n1970s\nThe 1970s saw the development of jazz fusion. It is questionable whether this can be considered a form of avant-garde jazz, though Miles Davis's recordings of this period, in particular, appear quite innovative and take inspiration from serialism and aleatoric music, just as the AACM did. In any case, hardcore jazz fans tended to regard early jazz fusion as a commercial sell-out move. However, by the mid-'70s, many free jazz icons, such as Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, and Ornette Coleman were experimenting with rock and funk. Coleman would eventually develop the free funk style, which would be further explored by the M-Base musicians in the 1980s.\n\nJazz also became considerably more international in the 1970s, as saxophonists Gato Barbieri (Argentine), Kaoru Abe (Japanese), Peter Brötzmann (German), and pianist Sergey Kuryokhin (Russian), attest. European free jazz, in particular, began to develop. Evan Parker and Derek Bailey were pioneers of the new non-idiomatic style. Some veteran avant-garde jazz musicians (Charlie Haden), and much of the new blood, including a number who had played with Miles Davis in the 1970s (Dave Holland, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea) and several Europeans (Jan Garbarek among them), began to record for the ECM label. The ECM sound, invariably recorded by Manfred Eicher, tended towards an elegant, refined, polished style that owed a great deal to the history of classical music. ECM also released recordings of minimalist and medieval music, and work by the Art Ensemble of Chicago (who were considerably messier than the ECM stereotype would indicate). A number of the AACM and ECM musicians would collaborate with one another, for example in the group Circle.\n\nMany of the AACM musicians moved to New York City, where they provided the nucleus of the loft jazz scene. The World Saxophone Quartet also emerged from this milieu.\n\n1980s\nThe 1980s saw the pre-eminence of Wynton Marsalis and his classicist approach, and a resulting diminution of the visibility of the avant-garde. However, as avant-garde jazz was a prime influence on no wave, New York City became the center of a new crop of aggressive improvisors: John Zorn, Borbetomagus, the Lounge Lizards, James Chance, James Blood Ulmer, Sonny Sharrock, Diamanda Galás, Bill Laswell (who also worked on Herbie Hancock's funk and electro recordings) and Bill Frisell (who had also recorded with the ECM musicians) among them. This development is referred to as punk jazz.\n\nJohn Zorn, in particular, became an iconic figure in the \"downtown\" music scene, performing in free jazz, free improvisation, and a variety of rock and extreme music styles. Many of these musicians actually resided in Brooklyn; Tim Berne is a prominent representative.\n\n1990s\nThe 1990s saw a return in visibility to the Chicago jazz scene, including players with links to the AACM. Most prominent are David Boykin, Aaron Getsug, Nicole Mitchell, Karl E. H. Seigfried, and Isaiah Spencer - all of who came up through Fred Anderson's Velvet Lounge. Other players include Ken Vandermark, Jeff Parker, and Kevin Drumm; these musicians had connections to the post-rock or noise rock scenes.\n\nLikewise, there was an increase in vitality in the remnants of the loft jazz scene in New York, centered around David S. Ware. Matthew Shipp, Susie Ibarra, and William Parker practiced a more traditional variety of avant-garde jazz than the punk jazz-inflected downtown musicians, though some collaboration did occur between the two camps. Matthew Shipp eventually collaborated with illbient and alternative hip hop musicians (DJ Spooky, Antipop Consortium, El-P), and moved towards a distinctive brand of nu jazz comparable to that of Craig Taborn. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Avant-Garde+Jazz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "A \"type of dance music, played on electronic instruments and with a slow beat\", according to Longman Dictionary, trip-hop (also known in the past as the \"Bristol sound\") is, in fact, a musical movement that started in Bristol, UK. The tag isn't limited to Bristol-based bands though; bands as far as Canada (eg. Perfume Tree) or Costa Rica (eg. Úztari) have been considered 'trip-hop'.  Many 'trip-hop' bands like Massive Attack, Portishead or Tricky have denied the term though, claiming it to be \"an invention of media journalists\". (It was in fact coined by Luke Vibert aka Wagon Christ).\n\nTrip-hop music is widely considered to be part of electronic music. However, unlike most sub-genres of electronic music, trip-hop has a mostly organic sound that rarely puts emphasis on electronic instruments. At first, bands like Portishead have been considered 'alternative rock' in the lack of a term like trip-hop; however, the mood of most trip-hop music is different from the mood of most alternative rock music. Also, guitars aren't used often and, when they are used, they are used in a moderate proportion, whilst drums and vocals are the main instruments.\n\nAfter the initial success generated by Portishead's Dummy album, in the mid-/late '90s discussion took place on the subject of so-called 'trip-hop' bands using the Portishead formula without presenting enough innovations to be considered not clones. There were many pop-oriented bands who didn't use the 'cabaret noir' elements of the Portishead sound, often resulting in a sound that resembles Morcheeba or Hooverphonic. Even so, many such bands presented special elements or contributions that made them overcome the 'Portishead clone' tag and enter the ranks of trip-hop databases such as Tripofagia or Tripnotic.\n\nIn trip-hop music, influences from hip-hop, dub, techno, rock and pop exist. Most commonly, artists/bands that can be deemed trip-hop are identified by their sound. Trip-hop bands can draw from an even greater pool of influences than this, bands like Hungry Lucy or Sunday Munich are influenced by goth/darkwave/ethereal; projects like Sestatee or early material from Amstrong use industrial elements; also, many bands like Halou, Bowery Electric or Lunascape draw their influence from dream pop/shoegazer music.\n\nBecause of the breath of influences trip-hop musicians draw from, many artists from genres such as instrumental hip-hop, melodic IDM, acid jazz or downtempo are tagged as trip-hop. In order to avoid having only beats, many instrumental hip-hop artists use (vocal) samples, often from other genres such as jazz or classical - creating an atmosphere that resembles the Bristol sound. Therefore, many artists from labels such as Ninja Tune have been associated with trip-hop, even though tags like instrumental hip-hop or acid jazz would be more fitting. More melodic IDM artists like Wagon Christ or Yppah have also been called 'trip-hop'; while both cited artists are on Ninja Tune (a label closely identified with trip-hop), they were called 'trip-hop' mostly because they use beats that are specific to this sound. What differentiates these producer's music from trip-hop is the syncopation of the beats and the inclusion of IDM-specific glitches along them.\n\nIt's common for trip-hop and downtempo to be confused. Although trip-hop is generally downtempo, not all trip-hop songs are downbeat and most of them are dark and tensioned, unlike downtempo music. Because of the confusion between the styles, certain downtempo musicians like Thievery Corporation are also regarded as trip-hop. Other styles that are confused with trip-hop are acid jazz, nu-jazz, and lounge. Label Ayia Napa has a compilation series \"From Trip Hop To Nu Jazz - A Smooth Transition\" which feature artists in between these styles, showcasing the musical similarities between them. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/trip-hop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The British synthesizer artists such as Depeche Mode and New Order who arose in the wake of Kraftwerk were most commonly known as new wave or synthpop.  The word electropop may have been used for these acts, but it was not yet common.\n\nStarting in the early 1980's, the word electro was used to describe artists such as Herbie Hancock, Afrika Bambaataa and Man Parrish who played funk-like music using synthesizers. \n\nStarting around 1997, bands such as Fischerspooner and Ladytron revived 1980's-style synthpop with characteristic deadpan vocals, but the movement was marketed as electroclash.  In 2002, Benny Benassi released 'Satisfaction,' and crackly synthesizer began to become a common feature of electro house, and the electropop music inspired by it.  Electropop often has more emphasis on clear vocals than electroclash or electro house, but there is a good deal of common ground between these three genres.\n\nSignature modern electropop songs include \"Heartbeats\" by The Knife and \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electropop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The series pitched in B♭ and E♭, designed for military bands, has proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. A few saxophones remain from the less popular orchestral series pitched in C and F.\n\n\nWhile proving very popular in its intended niche of military band music, the saxophone is most commonly associated with popular music, big band music, blues, early rock and roll, ska and particularly jazz. There is also a substantial repertoire of concert music in the classical idiom for the members of the saxophone family.

        "content": "Disco is a genre of dance-oriented music that originated in African American, gay and Hispanic American communities in 1970s. In what is considered a forerunner to disco style clubs in February 1970 New York City DJ David Mancuso opened The Loft, a members-only private dance club set in his own home. Most agree that the first disco songs were released in 1973, though some claim that Soul Makossa by Manu Dibango's from 1972 to be the first disco record. The first article about disco was written in September 1973 by Vince Aletti for Rolling Stone Magazine. In 1974 New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.\n\nMusical influences include funk, soul music. The disco sound has a soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady \"four-on-the-floor\" beat, an eighth note (quaver) or sixteenth note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and prominent, syncopated electric bass line. Strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and unlike in rock, lead guitar is rarely used.\n\nWell-known late 1970s disco performers included Bee Gees, Donna Summer and The Jacksons. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular female disco artist, and also played a part in pioneering the electronic sound that later became a part of disco. While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, the behind-the-scenes producers played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the \"disco sound\". Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever and Thank God It's Friday contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity and ironically the beginning of its commercial decline. \n\nDuring this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, MCA Records purchased ABC Records, absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. RSO Records founder Robert Stigwood left the label in 1981 and TK Records closed in the same year. Salsoul Records folded in 1984. Casablanca Records had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company PolyGram.\n\nMany groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The Bee Gees, for instance, only had one major hit in the United States after the 1970s—even though later songs they wrote and had others perform were successful. Of the handful of groups not taken down by disco's fall from favor, The Jacksons—and Michael Jackson in particular—stand out: In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on, they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond.\n\nAs disco's popularity sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major U.S. record labels and producers, European disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene. European acts Silver Convention, Love and Kisses, Munich Machine, and American acts Donna Summer and the Village People, were acts that defined the late 1970s Euro disco sound. Producers Giorgio Moroder, whom AllMusic described as \"one of the principal architects of the disco sound\" with the Donna Summer hit \"I Feel Love\" (1977), and Jean-Marc Cerrone were involved with Euro disco. The German group Kraftwerk also had an influence on Euro disco.\n\nBy far the most successful Eurodisco act was ABBA. This Swedish quartet—with such hits as \"Waterloo\" (1974), \"Fernando\" (1976), \"Take a Chance on Me\" (1978), \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" (1979), and their signature smash \"Dancing Queen\" (1976)—ranks as the eighth best-selling act of all time. Other prominent European pop and disco groups were Luv' from the Netherlands and Boney M., a group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by West German record producer Frank Farian. Boney M. charted worldwide hits with such songs as \"Daddy Cool\", \"Ma Baker\" and \"Rivers of Babylon\".\n\nAnother euro-disco act was Amanda Lear, where eurodisco sound is most heard in Enigma (\"Give a bit of Mmh to me\") song (1978).In France, Claude François who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released \"La plus belle chose du monde\", a French version of the Bee Gees hit record, \"Massachusetts\", which became a big hit in Canada and Europe and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide hit. Dalida released \"J'attendrai\", which became a big hit in Canada and Japan, and Cerrone's early hit songs, \"Love in C Minor\", \"Give Me Love\" and \"Supernature\" became major hits in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe resurgence of Disco, the second generation of Disco artists, commonly referred to as \"Dance\" or \"Dance Pop\" artists took shape. By this point, this style of music no longer favoured only the highly orchestral song structure. Post-disco (club music or dance) is the significant period in popular music history that followed the commercial \"death\" of disco music that emerged during late 1970s and early 1980s. The stripped-down musical trends followed from the DJ- and producer-driven, increasingly electronic and experimental side of disco, and were typified by the styles of dance-pop, boogie, italo disco and the early alternative dance. Techno and house are both rooted in post-disco music. From 1990 forward, while not commonly referred to as Disco, continued to gain mainstream success. \n\nNu-disco is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco aesthetics. The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport.\nThese vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also used to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres electroclash and french house.\n\nIn 2013, several 1970s-style disco and R&B songs charted, and the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s. The biggest disco hit of the year as of June was \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk, featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar. The song was initially thought likely to be a leading candidate to become the summer's biggest hit that year; however, the song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks behind another major disco-styled song, Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\", which spent twelve weeks at number 1 on the Hot 100, and in the process became the eventual song of the summer itself. Both were popular with a wide variety of demographic groups. Other disco-styled songs that made it into the top 40 were Justin Timberlake's \"Take Back The Night\" (No. 29), and Bruno Mars' \"Treasure\" (No. 5) and and Michael Jackson's posthumous release \"Love Never Felt So Good\" (No. 9). \n\nIn addition, Arcade Fire's Reflektor and Daft Punk's Random Access Memories, both featured strong disco elements, topped the Billboard 200 in 2013. In 2014, disco music could be found in Lady Gaga's \"Artpop\" and Katy Perry's \"Birthday\" and in 2015 with Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars \"Uptown Funk\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Disco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This music was derived from blues and early rock 'n' roll styles equally, with a lot of inter-exchange between all three. Over time, non-Black people began to adapt the style, and with time began to incorporate further changes. In the fifties, under the influence of Muddy Waters, Black guitarists and pianists, made a revolution in rhythm and blues by creating a quick-moving melody that had a frenzied, energetic rhythm. This further characterized the genre as its own unique identity.\n\nIn the 60's British rhythm and blues began to develop, and the central spot where the popular groups gathered was London. R&B had already gained a foothold in the United States and in Europe in prior years, and thus had a huge number of fans. Other developments included the emergence of soul music, which was a development of emotional balladry within R&B music. In the 70's, R&B was revitalized and became more danceable. The first records of this type belonged to James Brown. The mid 70's has opened a more modern period in the history of this style. In the 80's, successful singers, such as Luther Vandross, became famous due to romantic ballads, while Michael Jackson made soul and R&B music that was more modern, rock-inspired and even aggressive.\n\nNowadays, R&B has evolved into a particular style known as contemporary R&B, which is a music genre of western popular music at large. Although the acronym “R&B” originates from its association with traditional rhythm and blues music, the term R&B is today most often used to define a style of African American music originating after the demise of disco in the 1980's. This newer style combines elements of soul, funk, dance, and, from 1986 on with the advent of New Jack Swing branded R&B, hip hop.\nThe abbreviation R&B is almost always used instead of the full rhythm and blues term, although some sources refer to the style as urban contemporary (the name of the radio format that plays hip hop and contemporary R&B).\n\nContemporary R&B has a slick, electronic record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, the occasional guitar riff to give the song a rock feel, the occasional saxophone solo to give a jazz feel (mostly common in R&B songs prior to the year 1993), and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Uses of hip hop-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop is usually reduced and smoothed out. R&B vocalists are often known for their use of melisma, popularized by vocalists such as Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, and Mariah Carey. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/r&b\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Though it’s far less aggressively masculine, emo directly birthed from hardcore and therefore also concerns itself with authenticity and anti-commercialism; the genre grew out of the idea that commercial music was too artificial and calculated to express any true emotion. Because emo values authentic and deep emotion that defies rationality, the music can be a bit overexaggerated in its search for ever grander statements. But at its best, emo has a colossal power that manages to be emotional, inspiring, and intimate all at the same time.\n\nThe groundwork for emo was laid by Hüsker Dü’s classic Zen Arcade, which expanded the possibilities of hardcore bands to deal with more personal subject matter and write more melodic and technically challenging songs. Emo arose from Washington, D.C. a short while after, among the remains of the hardcore scene that had spawned Minor Threat and Bad Brains. \nThe word emo (or as it sometimes is called, emocore) was in the beginning used to describe hardcore bands that had frontmen who sang more eloquently instead of the usual shouts and rants; the first true emo band was Rites of Spring, which was then followed by ex-Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye’s short-lived Embrace. \nThe MacKaye-founded label Dischord Records became the center for D.C.’s evolving emo scene, as it released records by Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty, Nation of Ulysses, and eventually Ian MacKaye’s new band formed together with members from Rites of Spring, Fugazi. \nFugazi became the definitive early emo band, as they appealed to alternative rock listeners and received attention for their strictly anti-commercial ethics. Aside from Dischord, emo was in the beginning deeply underground, recorded by extremely short-lived bands and released in small amounts by small labels; some of these band’s vocalists actually wept onstage during song climaxes, earning ridicule from hardcore purists.\n\nNot counting Fugazi, emo didn’t truly break out until the mid-’90s due to Sunny Day Real Estate, whose early records practically defined the style for many listeners. Taking the intricate guitar work of Fugazi and combining it with Seattle grunge, genuine prog-rock, and softly sentimental vocals, Sunny Day Real Estate created an immense legacy influencing many who related to their dramatic melodies and inward-looking mysticism. \nSome of these listeners connected equally to the ironic, geeky introspection and catchy pop-punk of Weezer’s Pinkerton album. \n\nSeveral artists and bands contined to build on the groundwork laid by Fugazi (like Quicksand and Drive Like Jehu), but most ’90s bands took inspiration from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer. \nBands like the Promise Ring, the Get Up Kids, Braid, Texas Is the Reason, Jimmy Eat World, Joan of Arc, and Jets to Brazil also greatly influenced the [indie rock scene, thereby making emo one of the more popular underground rock styles by the turn of the millennium. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/emo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although featuring a wide range of bands including Primal Scream, Bogshed, Half Man Half Biscuit, and The Wedding Present, it over time became shorthand for a genre known by a variety of terms. Initially it was dubbed 'C86' (after the tape itself), the more ambiguous indie pop, Cutie or a term coined by John Peel: shambling bands. Retrospectively, especially in the United States, the terms twee and twee pop were used, initially ironically, due to what commentators called the \"revolt into childhood\" of its followers.\n\nMusically its key characteristics were jangling guitars, a love of sixties pop and often fey, innocent lyrics. The UK label Sarah Records and its most popular band The Field Mice, although more diverse than the label indicates, were probably its most typical proponents. It was also inspired by the DIY scene of punk and there was a thriving fanzine, label and club and gig circuit. Scenes later developed in the United States particularly around labels such as K Records. Genres such as Riot Grrrl and bands as diverse as Nirvana, Manic Street Preachers, and Belle and Sebastian have all acknowledged its influence.\n\nIn the mid to late 80s, indie pop was criticized for its tweeness and underachievement but many now argue that C86 and the birth of the genre was a pivotal moment for independent music in the UK. It continues to have a strong following and inspire musicians, not just in the UK but around the world with new labels, clubs and bands devoted to the sound. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie+pop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The term \"alternative\" was coined in the 1980s to describe punk rock-inspired bands on independent record labels that did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. As a musical genre, alternative rock consists of various subgenres that have emerged from the independent music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, Britrock, gothic rock, Grebo/Crusty and indie rock. These genres are unified by their collective debt to the style and/or ethos of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s.\n\nThough the genre is considered to be rock, some of its subgenres are influenced by folk music, reggae, electronic music and jazz among other genres. At times alternative rock has been used as a catch-all phrase for rock music from underground artists in the 1980s, all music descended from punk rock (including punk itself, New Wave, and post-punk), and, ironically, for mainstream rock music in general in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nWhile a few artists like R.E.M. and The Cure achieved commercial success and mainstream critical recognition, many alternative rock artists during the 1980s were cult acts that recorded on independent labels and received their exposure through college radio airplay and word-of-mouth. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the early 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became commercially successful.

Bands that were active before the popularization of psychedelia, such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, began to move their music in a more psychedelic direction as well.\n\nThere are many subgenres of psychedelic rock as well, such as space rock, acid rock, and psychedelic pop. From the seeds of psychedelic rock emerged genres like hard rock, heavy metal, progressive rock, and experimental rock. Neo-psychedelia began to emerge in the 1980s, with bands such as Spacemen 3 and Loop.

Also of note are the Sugar Hill Gang who come from Englewood, New Jersey, who had the first rap single to crack the Top 40. Later, Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys emerged in the 80's to help bridge the gap between hip-hop and rock fans worldwide. In the late 80's and early 90's, with the rise of N.W.A. and Dr. Dre, the West Coast wrested control from the East as the dominant style in mainstream rap.

Black metal bands from the United States, such as Profanatica and VON, also formed around this time. Most modern black metal has built upon the groundwork laid by bands during this time period. Furthermore, following a series of church burnings associated with black metal musicians and the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem by Burzum's Varg Vikernes, the Norwegian black metal scene received considerable attention from the mainstream media.\n\nThere is no well-defined 'third wave' of black metal, but many modern bands have explored territory outside of the traditional frameworks of the genre. Bands such as Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega are particularly known for incorporating various unorthodox elements into their music. Other bands, such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, have become more popular by incorporating gothic sensibilities with a basic black metal framework, with both bands renowned for their use of prominent keyboards and synthesizers especially.\n\nAlthough there are exceptions, modern black metal as a musical style tends to make use of high-pitched tremolo picking, shrieked or growled vocals, blast beats, unconventional song structures and an emphasis on atmosphere over technical playing styles. Black metal rarely features verse-chorus structures, generally favoring a more basic style that features extended musical sections and repetitive guitar riffs. Guitar solos are a rarity in black metal, although they are featured prominently in the music of some bands. Black metal often features very lo-fi, primitive recording quality reminiscent of the early days of the genre, but some bands have favored more professional recording techniques. While the harsh vocal style of black metal has become nearly universal, some bands still feature clean vocals, used either in conjunction with more extreme vocals or as the primary vocal style.\n\nSome black metal bands have incorporated keyboards, neofolk instruments or other musical influences into their music. Emperor was a key band in the development of symphonic black metal, with many later bands adopting a similar, keyboard-heavy style. Bands such as Ulver and Nokturnal Mortum incorporated influences from ethnic folk music. Other influences from music such as martial industrial and dark ambient are also common. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/black+metal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Allmusic states that, “of all rock & roll’s myriad forms, heavy metal is the most extreme in terms of volume, machismo and theatricality.”\n\nHeavy metal has long had a worldwide following of fans known as metalheads or headbangers. Although early heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, they were often critically reviled at the time. A status common throughout the history of the genre. In the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre’s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence. Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden and Motörhead followed in a similar vein, introducing a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, pop-infused glam metal became a major commercial force with groups like Mötley Crüe. Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme, aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, also leading the development of more extreme styles, such as death metal and black metal, which remain subcultural phenomena. Alternative Metal later followed these, as a reaction to both: being more accessible than the extreme styles typified by death metal (while not as overtly commercial as hair metal) while also being musically varied and sonically adventurous. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles such as nu metal, which often incorporates elements of funk and hip hop; and metalcore, which blends extreme metal with hardcore punk, have further expanded the definition of the genre.\n\nOther subgenres of metal include power metal, speed metal, melodic death metal (also known as Gothenburg metal), Industrial metal, nu-metal, thrash metal, black metal, doom metal, death metal, progressive metal and folk metal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/metal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Post-punk is a rock music movement with its roots in the late 1970s, following on the heels of the initial punk rock explosion of the mid-1970s. The genre retains its roots in the punk movement but is more introverted, complex and experimental. It found a firm place in the 1980s independent scene, and led to the development of genres such as gothic rock, industrial music and alternative rock.\n\nPost-punk began in the late 1970s and persisted into the early 1980s.  Contrary to what the name would imply, post-punk really developed along side and with punk rock as opposed to after punk's initial 1977 boom. However, because it was a much less limited genre sonically, post-punk did enjoy a significantly longer lifespan than the rock and roll revivalism of the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, etc.  While punk itself soon came to have a signature sound, a few acts began to experiment with more challenging musical structures, lyrical themes, and a self-consciously art-based image, while retaining punk's initial iconoclastic stance.\n\nMusically, post-punk is fairly diverse, though there are some important genre identifiers, most of which derive from krautrock, dub reggae, the work of progressive-thinking garage rock groups like The Velvet Underground, Roxy Music, and Hawkwind, and other avant-garde and world musics.  Most post-punk features a very prominent bass guitar, some use of electronic instrumentation, jagged, angular guitar work and melodies, highly poetic lyrics, and a generally intellectual attitude towards the proceedings derived from art rock, although none of these are necessarily requirements. Post-punk was largely produced in North America and the British Isles, and key groups from those regions include Pere Ubu, Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, Mission of Burma, and Joy Division, among countless others. There also was a worldwide post-punk following which produced bands like France's Métal Urbain, Australia's The Birthday Party, The Church and Tactics, and Ireland's U2 and the Virgin Prunes.  \n\nBands such as Crass also came within the scope of post-punk, as with several outfits formed in the wake of traditionally punk rock groups: Magazine was formed by a member of Buzzcocks, for instance, and Public Image Ltd. derived from the Sex Pistols. A list of predecessors to the post-punk genre of music might include Television, whose album Marquee Moon, although released in 1977 at the height of the punk movement, is considered by some definitively post-punk in style. Other groups, such as The Clash, remained predominantly punk in nature, yet were inspired by the experimentalism of the post-punk movement, most notably in their album Sandinista!.\n\nThe original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics, just as post-punk bands had originally left punk rock behind in favor of new sounds, critically acclaimed but never particularly commercially successful.  Bands who began playing post-punk only found mass commercial success once they excised the more difficult elements of their sound in favor of sonic elements associated with pop and dance music. Many post-punk bands, most notably The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees, evolved into gothic rock (formerly a style of the larger post-punk movement) and became identified with the goth subculture. Some shifted to a more commercial New Wave sound (such as Talking Heads), while others were fixtures on American college radio and became early examples of alternative rock (such as U2).  Post-punk was immensely influential; its various facets spawning, influencing and inspiring Britain's independent label infrastructure, the goth subculture, massively internationally popular groups like the previously mentioned U2, The Smiths, R.E.M., and Red Hot Chili Peppers, post-punk's own pop-friendly cousin new wave, the post-hardcore music of the late 1980s and 1990s, among other things and styles.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to the new millenium, a second wave of post-punk emerged, incorporing sounds and aesthetic of the original post-punk, along with influences new wave and, at times, of dance music. This wave, commonly known as \"post-punk revival\" either draw particular influence from the more angular strain of post-punk such as Wire and Gang of Four or are more clearly indebted to the atmospheric wing of post-punk epitomized by Echo & The Bunnymen and Joy Division.\n\nAn extensive list of post-punk, post-punk influenced and post-punk revival bands can be found here. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Emo rap artists tend therefore to have a mournful delivery when flowing over their emo influenced hip hop music. Sampling is also a widely used method to create emo rap, with many artists rapping, crooning, and singing over Midwest Emo, Emo-Pop, and Pop Punk samples. This genre also contributes to the \"emo revival\" phenomenon, which started in the early 2010s. \n\nIn the late 2000s, references to the \"emo rap\" term were already being made, crediting for instance Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon: The End of Day album for incorporating some emo elements in the lyricism like mentions of concepts like depression, loneliness, and anxiety. Allusions to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak and Drake's So Far Gone were also being made. However it was the early 2010s that multiple artists such as BONES, Black Kray, and Yung Lean were starting to bring stylistic techniques of emo, melancholic lyricism, and lethargy into hip hop and were getting more attention from listeners and publicists. Seemingly underground artists soon took it upon themselves to flagship this style of hip hop and emo into their own music, with formerly named Yung Bruh, Lil Peep, and the GothBoiClique putting material out in the mid 2010s, with more focused attempts to establish emo rap as a music genre. \n\nAround the mid to late 2010s, emo rap broke through the mainstream and gained renowned popularity and critical attention with the main examples of Lil Peep's [song]\"Awful Things\"[/song], XXXTENTACION's [song]\"Jocelyn Flores\"[/song], Lil Xan's [song]\"Betrayed\"[/song], Trippie Redd [song] \"Love Scars\" and most notably Lil Uzi Vert's [song]\"XO Tour Llif3\"[/song] being emo rap hits.

It had close ties to punk rock and fairly strong influences of the musical style that had been invented and continuously developed throughout the 1970s: reggae.\n\nThe term  New Wave  was first a kind of description of a more musical and lyric wise complex music than punk. It was sometimes ironically used to describe  punk band \"who had learned to play their instruments\". This is of course not true. The Police, Elvis Costello, The Pretenders, The Beat, The Jam, Blondie, The Cars, Talking Heads etc, could all play before releasing recordings. There were values as anti-racism (that's one reason for the reggae connection) and a widespread dissatisfaction with the government Thatcher's economic policies. Later came more and more initiatives from artists to start their own record labels\n\nAround 1979-81 there were influences from punk, rock, pop, roots reggae , ska revival (2 tone), dub , very early Beatles songs and world music . Ultimately led the ambition to unite music, internationalism and social engagement that two new wave artists – Bob Geldof and Midge Ure – took the initiative to the big help galas for a starving Ethiopia,\n\nIn the early 80s there were strong reactions among the punk and reggae friendly new wavers with left-wing views against counting the bands who used the new synthesizer / electronic technology in their music as new wave bands. But these new synth bands, as New Order, Human League and Depeche Mode would soon be incorporated into the new wave crowd. One reason was that it soon became impossible to separate them. Traditional new wave band enlisted the help of synths, and synth bands made socially critical songs or used their instruments in reggae dub versions. Culture Club was new wave as well as Nina Hagen and Nena. But that does not mean that all 80's songs were new wave, which some record companies trying to tell new, young listeners.\n\n\nNew Wave, as a term, has been used to describe all post-punk rock music, yet, it distances itself from other post-punk movements as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more \"arty\" post-punk.\n\nAs a genre, it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos yet it is characterized by greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of New Wave music, aside from its punk influences, include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, the importance of styling and the arts, as well as a great amount of diversity. As a term, New Wave is often used to describe music which was quirky and eccentric, yet also catchy and pop at heart, incorporating clear melodious hooks. In such a way, its style varies greatly, ranging from 1950s and 60s rock revivalism, ska and reggae-styled music, to synthpop-oriented dance.\n\nNew Wave is seen as one of the definitive genres of the 1980s; at the time, it enjoyed commercial success as several of the major artists and groups of the time were labelled New Wave. The genre became a fixture on MTV, and the popularity of several New Wave artists has been partially attributed to the exposure that was given to them by the channel.In the mid-1980s differences between New Wave and other music genres began to blur. New Wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s, after a \"nostalgia\" for New Wave swept across the music scene, influencing several artists.The revivals in the 1990s and early 2000s were small, but became popular by 2004; subsequently, the genre has influenced a variety of music genres and is influenced by the same variety. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/new+wave\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

No one disputes that IU, BTS and FT Island are \"K-pop artists,\" but musically, they share little in common. IU's discography features many ballads, BTS is very rap-heavy, and FT Island performs light rock. These three artists perform popular music originating from Korea, so they are labeled under the umbrella term \"K-pop.\"\n\nHere is an alternate definition that is more widely recognized: K-pop is often released by entertainment and management companies, choreographed by professionals, and performed by young vigorously trained singers, dancers, and rappers who debut and then referred to as \"idols\" (아이들).\n\nThe alternative definition does not define anything that did not exist before K-pop arrived at the scene. Identifying young talents and fastidiously grooming them to become pop stars have been one of the basic business strategies in pop music as long as there was such a thing as pop music. Motown in the 1960s was famous for it. The only possible distinction between the \"K-pop\" mode of production and \"Motown\" mode of production is... K-pop is from Korea. Once again, we return to the fact K-pop is simply pop music originating from South Korea.\n\nModern form of Korean pop music can be traced back to the early 90s. The term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term Gayo (가요), which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. Although it generally indicates \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world.\n\nModern Korean pop \"idol\" culture began with the boy band H.O.T in 1996. Korean pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms consiting of people of all ages, including teens and young adults. After a slump in early K-pop, in 2003, TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of Korean pop \"idols\" that broke the music genre and influenced the neighboring Japanese market (J-pop) and that continue to popularize Korean pop music internationally today. With the advent of online social networking services and Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and Korean entertainment, known as the \"Hallyu Wave\" (\"한류\") or \"Korean Wave\", is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East, and throughout the Western world, gaining a widespread global audience. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/k-pop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form of the blues, blues rock, developed by combining of blues with various rock and roll forms. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/blues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Bedroom pop is a style of Indie Pop which arose in the 2010s, named for solo producers and singer-songwriters who created intimate, \"authentic\" music in their own homes, outside of a traditional studio environment. The genre is generally characterised by a warm, reverbed, and hazy or sleepy atmosphere inspired by the psychedelic and nostalgic sounds of Hypnagogic Pop as well as elements of its intentionally lo-fi recording aesthetic, though in bedroom pop this is often done out of necessity. Other key parts of the sound come from styles that are pastiched by hypnagogic pop, such as the surreal and sometimes comical elements of Psychedelic Pop, Sophisti-Pop's focus on complex chords and influence from Soul and Jazz, and the synthesizer-driven sound of Synthpop and Synth Funk. Also sometimes included are elements from music popular in the 1990s alternative scene, like the subdued, reverbed sound of Dream Pop and the smooth and nocturnal atmosphere of Trip Hop.\n\nIn contrast to the often experimental and anti-commercial hypnagogic pop, bedroom pop typically remains within more accessible bounds, and pulls all these influences into a more conventional and modern Pop direction with melodic songwriting and vocal styles often informed by Contemporary R&B (and particularly Alternative R&B). Though some bedroom pop artists use acoustic instruments reminiscent of Indie Folk or electric Rock-based arrangements, many make prominent use of Electronic instrumentation, pulling from 2000s Indietronica and especially the dreamy, summery, washed-out sound of Chillwave, which in mood acted as a direct precursor to the bedroom pop sound. Lyrically, bedroom pop focuses on more personal and confessional songs, sometimes sung in hushed tones to create a more intimate atmosphere, or with a laid-back and lethargic sound to match the music.\n\nThe term \"bedroom pop\" has been in use for decades to describe all manner of home recording projects and DIY artists, particularly those associated with Lo-Fi / Slacker Rock. However, the first hints of a distinct musical style by this name would not emerge until the early 2010s, when the term gained traction with artists surrounding the Orchid Tapes label, including Alex G, Elvis Depressedly, and Ricky Eat Acid, with a sound that was lo-fi, dreamy, and even occasionally inspired by Ambient. At the same time, Mac DeMarco would carve a niche of his own that, while still rooted in rock, combined the laid-back sound of those artists with retro elements from hypnagogic pop that would serve as the genre's foundation. Newer artists like Clairo, Rex Orange County, and Boy Pablo would take and run with this sound in the mid-2010s, with greater R&B and electronic influences that would help to establish bedroom pop as an even more distinct sound. These artists would become popular on the internet through platforms like YouTube, Bandcamp, and SoundCloud which allow independent artists to upload their own music, as well as Spotify, whose \"Bedroom Pop\" playlist would group these artists and help to define the sound. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/bedroom+pop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Some of Korean Pop's biggest idols are BoA, Girls' Generation, BIGBANG, Wonder Girls, 2NE1, Super Junior and PSY.\n\nPlease Note: The word K-Pop is Not a Genre nor a Style!!!\nK-Pop\n\"K-Pop\"  (abbreviation of Korean Pop Music; Korean: 케이팝) is Korean Popular Music originating in South Korea. The realistic is that the word \"K-Pop' is more of an industry than a  Genre , and at the same time it's created and leads with a distinct sound that's a mixing of genres such as Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B and Pop/EDM but also broken into individual styles (Genres) such as Rock, Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, EDM and Bubble Pop.\n\n\"K-pop\" is a generic term that means absolutely nothing more than \"popular music of Korea.\" The term \"K-pop\" rigorously, and thought hard about the kinds of music and the kinds of artists the term covers, you will find that it cannot possibly denote a genre or a style.\n\nTo start, the simplest overview of musical styles that fall under the label \"K-pop\" should make clear that \"K-pop\" does not refer to a musical genre. No one disputes that IU, BTS and FT Island are \"K-pop artists,\" but musically, they share nothing in common. IU sings mostly standard pop, BTS performs mostly hip hop numbers, and FT Island, light rock. The commonality among IU, BTS and FT Island is not, and cannot be, music. Their only commonality is that they all perform popular music of Korea.\n\n Alternative definition of K-pop goes roughly like this: \"highly processed but easy-to-listen music, composed and choreographed by professional management companies, performed by beautiful young men or women groomed to become pop stars by the said management companies.\" \n\nFirst of all, the alternative definition does not actually define anything that did not exist previously. Identifying young talents and fastidiously grooming them to become pop stars have been one of the basic business strategies in pop music as long as there was such a thing as pop music. Motown in the 1960s was famous for it. The only possible distinction between the \"K-pop\" mode of production and \"Motown\" mode of production is... K-pop is from Korea. Once again, we return to the plain truth: the heart of the term \"K-pop\" is the fact that it is music of Korea.\n\nModern form of Korean Pop Music can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term Gayo (가요), which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. \nAlthough it generally indicates \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest Korean Pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.\n\nModern Korean Pop \"idol\" culture began with the boy band H.O.T. in 1996, as Korean Pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults. After a slump in early K-pop, from 2003 TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of Korean Pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market (Japanese Pop) and continue to popularize Korean Pop Music internationally today. With the advent of online social networking services and Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and throughout the Western world, gaining a widespread global audience. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Kpop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Additionally, the arrangements often incorporate elements drawn from classical, jazz, and avant-garde music. Instrumental songs are more common, and songs with lyrics are sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used \"concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme\".\n\nProgressive rock developed from late-1960s psychedelic rock and jazz fusion, as part of a wide-ranging tendency in rock music of this era to draw inspiration from ever more diverse influences. The term came into most widespread use around the mid-1970s. While progressive rock reached the peak of its popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s, neo-progressive bands have continued playing for faithful audiences in the subsequent decades. Progressive rock sharply declined in popularity for much of the 1980s, but returned to prominence in the early-to-mid 1990s.\n\nSubgenres and related genres as categorised by the popular progressive rock site Prog Archives include Canterbury scene, crossover prog, experimental metal/post-metal, heavy prog, Indo-prog/raga rock, jazz rock/fusion, Krautrock, neo-prog, post-rock/math rock, progressive electronic, progressive folk, progressive metal, psychedelic rock/space rock, RIO/rock in opposition/avant-prog, rock progressivo italiano, symphonic prog, tech/extreme prog metal, and zeuhl. Symphonic prog is probably the sound most commonly associated with the genre, as most of its most influential acts at least dabbled in the style, and many of its most acclaimed albums (especially Close to the Edge by Yes, Selling England by the Pound) are exemplars of the style.\n\nThough frequently lambasted by critics, the genre continues to have a lasting influence on modern music, perhaps because its demonstrations of musical and compositional skill hold particular appeal to musicians, who have added appreciations for how difficult these styles are to perform. In addition to genres like post-rock, math rock, Krautrock, and experimental metal, already mentioned above, the genre is also an unmistakable influence on video game soundtracks. Perhaps because prog acts were early pioneers in incorporating synthesizers into popular music, some of the most influential video game composers in the world, including 近藤浩治 (Kōji Kondō, best known for his work on the Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda) series) and 植松伸夫 (Nobuo Uematsu, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series), have explicitly cited prog acts like Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Pink Floyd, and Deep Purple as some of their most important influences; 菊田裕樹 (Hiroki Kikuta, best known in the West for Secret of Mana), another VGM composer influenced by prog, also suggested that their shared love of bands like Emerson, Lake & Palmer may have been the tipping point that pushed Uematsu to hire him to compose for Square.\n\nIn a perhaps more unexpected case, some critics have also argued that prog has influenced the works of many alternative hip-hop acts such as Atmosphere, Aesop Rock, Cage, Caparezza, dälek, Kid Cudi, Lupe Fiasco, and Kanye West, many of whom have also sampled prog acts (most famously, West sampled \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" for \"Power\"). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Progressive+rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States. In the wake of the musical invasion into the United Kingdom of American grunge bands such as Nirvana, many bands positioned themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. Oasis, Blur and Pulp are often considered the scene's most prominent acts.\n\nWhile it may have been a reaction against inward-looking Grunge and Shoegaze, Britpop followed on from other existing \"good time\" British scenes such as Baggy and Grebo. Both of these (like Shoegaze) were evolutions of British Indie and Punk with some \"retro\" elements, but which combined them with electronic styles including Dance (and Hip-Hop and Industrial Rock to lesser extents), yet retaining a countercultural edge.\nHowever Britpop was generally a much more regressive style than any of these other genres, choosing mainstream appeal over oppositional counterculture and focusing more on 60's revivalism, pop-punk and songcraft than attempting to create new sounds, it possibly seeming at the time like most new things had been tried within an indie rock context. Both Blur and Oasis originally started off as bands in the Indie-Dance style (as did Radiohead, along with a flirtation with Grunge), but soon jettisoned these aspects for popular \"classic\" songwriting. However, electronic elements were present in many acts, and artists like Super Furry Animals and Mansun were notably experimental.\n\nAs Britain moved out of difficult 80s into the more affluent 90s, popular taste moved towards more easy-going guitar music and the mainstream embraced Britpop, causing an explosion in new guitar acts finding an audience eager and flush with the cash to buy their records.\n\nSome bands under the Britpop label did soon emerge that pushed the sound in different directions, most notably Radiohead and Mansun, who embraced strong progressive rock and experimental elements within a \"pop\" context. \n\nBritpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called \"Cool Britannia\". Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to America (and in the case of Mansun, Japan), the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade, and press attention turned to rawer Garage Rock revivals and more experimental acts once again. \n\nBritpop bands were influenced by British guitar music of the past, particularly British groups The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and The Small Faces; glam rock artists such as David Bowie and T. Rex; and punk rock bands like the The Jam, the Buzzcocks and Wire. Specific influences varied: Blur and Oasis drew from the Kinks and the Beatles, respectively, while Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock. Regardless, all Britpop artists projected a sense of reverence for the sounds of the past. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/britpop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "Hard rock is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage, blues rock and psychedelic rock. It is typified by a heavy use of distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, pianos, and keyboards.\n\nOne of the major influences of hard rock is blues music. American and British rock bands began to modify rock and roll, adding to the standard genre harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming and louder vocals. This sound created the basis for hard rock. Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the songs \"You Really Got Me\" by The Kinks (1964), \"My Generation\" by The Who (1965), \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles (1968), and \"I Feel Free\" by Cream (1966).\n\nHard rock emerged with groups of the late-1960s, such as The Who, Deep Purple, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock. Deep Purple helped pioneer the hard rock genre with the albums Shades of Deep Purple (1968), The Book of Taliesyn (1968), and Deep Purple (1969), but they made their big break with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, In Rock (1970). Led Zeppelin's eponymous first album, Led Zeppelin (1969), and The Who's Live at Leeds (1970), are examples of music from the beginning of the hard rock genre. The blues origins of the albums are clear, and a few songs by well-known blues artists are adapted or covered within them.\n\nLed Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin's second album, was a watershed moment for the identity of hard rock, proving more popular than their third album Led Zeppelin III (1970). While the heavy aspects of their music remained, Led Zeppelin III was more folk rock-oriented than their second. 1971 saw [The Who release their highly-acclaimed album Who's Next.\n\nBlack Sabbath's first two albums, both released in 1970, are considered as important as any in launching hard rock into the mainstream.\n\nDeep Purple's transformation of hard rock continued in 1972 with their album Machine Head, considered one of the first heavy metal albums, although some band members shunned that label. Two songs from Machine Head had great success: \"Highway Star\" and \"Smoke on the Water.\" The latter song's main riff made it, for many, the \"signature\" Deep Purple song. Nazareth, a band out of Scotland, provided a blend of hard rock which commercialised the genre further with their best selling album, Hair of the Dog, which in turn, influenced numerous other bands. Free released their signature song \"All Right Now\", which has received massive radio airplay in both the UK and US.\n\nIn 1979, the differences between the hard rock movement and the rising heavy metal movement were highlighted when the Australian hard rock band, AC/DC, released its second-biggest album, Highway to Hell. AC/DC's music was based mostly on rhythm & blues and early-1970s hard rock, with the group explicitly repudiating the \"heavy metal\" tag.\n\nThe late 1980s saw the most commercially successful time period for hard rock. At this time it was the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States. Numerous hard rock acts achieved hits in the mainstream charts. One of those hits was the album Slippery When Wet (1986) by Bon Jovi, which spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart, sold 12 million copies, and became the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles—two of which reached #1. In addition, the anthem rock album The Final Countdown by Swedish group Europe was released in 1986. It reached #8 on the U.S. charts, while hitting the top 10 in several other countries.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/hard+rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While many of the definitive electro tracks are, in essence, also Hip Hop, in many instances it is simply electronic Funk and can also be considered an evolutionary link between the work of electronic groups in the 70s such as Kraftwerk and Techno in the decade following. Electro's influence has long outlived its initial popularity with nearly every popular electronic dance genre at some point giving way to a hybridized electro subgenre.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electro\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
